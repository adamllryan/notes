**Image registration** aligns two images to the same coordinate frame. If two images have different fields of view, we can use image registration to map them to the same frame. First, we cover the feature-based approach to implementing this technique.

We start by finding the correspondence between features such as points, lines, and contours. Next, we use a transformation model. 

We have four choices for transformations:

- Isometric (Euclidian, translation/rotation/reflection).
- Affine (Similarity + skew/shear). 
- Similarity (Euclidian + isotropic scaling). 
- Projective/Homography (Affine + perspective)

**Ransac**, or random sample consensus, is a robust model that fits models containing outliers in data. It tries random subsets of the data in order to fit the model.
