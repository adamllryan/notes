The goal of region extraction is to extract a set of regions believed to be occupied by objects. Then, we group those pixels that are similar in some region property (such as intensity, color, texture, motion, ...). 

## Simple Extraction

A very simple example of extraction by pulling objects that have a different intensity when compared to the background pixels. We can do so via thresholding, where we set the pixel value to 1 if that pixel value is greater than our threshold otherwise 0.
