**Principal Component Analysis** is the idea of taking highly sparse data and processing it such that we reduce the sparseness of our data into a more efficient dataset.

As a simple example, take a linear relationship in two dimensions. The idea of PCA is to take that 2D relationship and reduce it through a linear function such that we can represent it in 1-dimensional space. In this case, we would use the equation $y=mx+b$ to map it into 1D space. This is **dimensionality reduction**.  
When we create a basis set, we can choose any set of vectors as long as they are perpendicular.

The process of conducting PCA can be found [[05_machine_learning#Principal Component Analysis|here]].
