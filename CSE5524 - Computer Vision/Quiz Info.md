Cutoff for Quiz one is mean shift tracking.

# Cheat Sheet

Single side, 8.5x11, anything but copied slide. You may copy paste formulas.

# Multiple Choice

1 or 2 short answer questions
All multiple choice/fill in the blakn, select multiple, matching
around 3 pages

# Short Answer

A little more involved, reserved for application questions. Instead of simple definition, these are reserved for application of definition questions. Maybe give an example and apply a concept.
No step by step questions through algorithms mentioned in class.

You will not need a calculator. Not like other course, there is no math at all.

# Review Day

Rolling Shutter vs. CCD:

CCD is always running, collecting charges. IT NEVER STOPS!!! It requires a shutter to stop measuring. Causes smearing, more clear.

CMOS does not have smearing but has rolling shutter effect. Also you can use shutter with CMOS. a

# Mean Shift Vector

The weight per at pixel i is determined by the kernel.

# Optic Flow

Aggregate mixe multiple pixels, smoothing
normal assumes motion having perpendicular edges. Normal flow is more susceptible to noise.

# Coarse to fine Motion

Big image on pyramid (highest-quality) is good at finding small motion, while small image is better for larger motion.

If we detect larger motion, we extract the image, shift it to where we think it may be in the next smaller scale (larger resolution) detector image and then try to reposition it.

KLT Tracking focuses on tracking the corner points only.

# Quiz 2

Covers weeks 7 through 12, or image segmentation through stereo vision, or note set 10 through 15
