# Motion

Motion is the change in position of an object in a sequence of images. Essentially, it is the change in pixels in that sequence of images over time. Typically, we deal with two scenarios: still and moving cameras. We also need to consider the amount of objects moving in a scene.

## Image Differencing

**Image differencing** is a simple method to detect motion. It is the process of subtracting one image from another. The result is a new image that shows the difference between the two images. The difference is then thresholded and then we have our result. This is useful for detecting motion in a scene where the camera is not moving. Image differencing is good for detecting motion _presence_, but not with direction.

How do we determine a threshold? We can use a fixed threshold, but this is not always the best option. We can also use a dynamic threshold, which is based on the mean and standard deviation of the pixel values. This is useful for scenes with varying lighting conditions. For a constant threshold, we compute the change as:

$$
\Delta I = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } |I_t - I_{t-1}| > T \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $I_t$ is the current frame and $I_{t-1}$ is the previous frame. $T$ is the threshold. If we use a dynamic threshold, we do:

$$
\Delta I = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } |I_t - I_{t-1}| > \mu + k\sigma \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. $k$ is a constant that we can set.

## Weber's Law

Weber's Law states that the just noticeable difference (JND) between two stimuli is proportional to the magnitude of the stimuli. This is useful for determining the threshold for image differencing. We can use the following formula to determine the threshold:

$$
T = k \cdot \frac{\Delta I}{I}
$$

where $T$ is the threshold, $k$ is a constant, $\Delta I$ is the change in intensity, and $I$ is the intensity of the pixel.

## Optical Flow

**Optical flow** is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene. It is the apparent motion of objects in a scene due to the relative motion between the observer and the scene. Optical flow is a 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from one frame to the next. It is a useful tool for understanding the motion of objects in a scene. It is also useful for understanding the 3D structure of the scene.

In a given sequence of images: if we take a single pixel at a location $(x,y)$ and observe it at another location in another sequence, then it will have the same brightness constancy. This will fail if the object moves into shadow.

The **brightness constancy constraint** states that the brightness of a pixel does not change between frames. This is a reasonable assumption for most scenes. The **spatial coherence constraint** states that the motion of a pixel is similar to the motion of its neighbors. This is also a reasonable assumption for most scenes. It can be written as the formula:

$$
I(x,y,t) = I(x + \Delta x, y + \Delta y, t + \Delta t)
$$

where $I(x,y,t)$ is the intensity of the pixel at location $(x,y)$ at time $t$. $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ are the displacements in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. $\Delta t$ is the time difference between the two frames.

## Aggregate Optical Flow

**Aggregate optical flow** is the average of the optical flow vectors in a region. This is useful for understanding the motion of objects in a scene. We can use the following formula to compute the aggregate optical flow:

$$
E=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(f_{xi}u+f_{yi}+f_{ti})^2\\

\frac{ \partial E}{\partial u} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}2(f_{xi}u+f_{yi}+f_{ti})f_{xi} = 0\\

u = -\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{xi}f_{ti}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{xi}^2}


$$

where $E$ is the error, $f_{xi}$ and $f_{yi}$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the optical flow vector, respectively. $f_{ti}$ is the time component of the optical flow vector. $u$ is the aggregate optical flow.

This can be written in matrix form as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    \sum f_{xi}^2 & \sum f_{xi}f_{yi} \\
    \sum f_{xi}f_{yi} & \sum f_{yi}^2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    u \\
    v
\end{bmatrix}
=
-\begin{bmatrix}
    \sum f_{xi}f_{ti} \\
    \sum f_{yi}f_{ti}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $u$ and $v$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the aggregate optical flow vector, respectively.

This effectively averages the pixels to find a center of mass for the motion. It is very similar to smoothing.

## Normal Optical Flow

**Normal optical flow** is the optical flow vector at a single pixel. We can use the following formula to compute the normal optical flow:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    f_{x} & f_{y} \\
    f_{y} & f_{t}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    u \\
    v
\end{bmatrix}
=
-\begin{bmatrix}
    f_{t} \\
    f_{t}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $f_{x}$ and $f_{y}$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the optical flow vector, respectively. $f_{t}$ is the time component of the optical flow vector. $u$ and $v$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the normal optical flow vector, respectively.

# Aperture Problem

The **aperture problem** is a problem in computer vision where the motion of an object is not fully visible. This is because the motion of the object is not fully visible in the aperture of the camera.

## Weighted Aggregate Normal Flow

**Weighted aggregate normal flow** is the average of the normal optical flow vectors in a region. This is useful for understanding the motion of objects in a scene. We can use the following formula to compute the weighted aggregate normal flow:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    \sum w^2f_{xi}^2 & \sum w^2f_{xi}f_{yi} \\
    \sum w^2f_{xi}f_{yi} & \sum w^2f_{yi}^2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    u \\
    v
\end{bmatrix}
=
-\begin{bmatrix}
    \sum w^2f_{xi}f_{ti} \\
    \sum w^2f_{yi}f_{ti}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $w$ is the weight of the pixel. $f_{xi}$ and $f_{yi}$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the optical flow vector, respectively. $f_{ti}$ is the time component of the optical flow vector. $u$ and $v$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the weighted aggregate normal flow vector, respectively.
