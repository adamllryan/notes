Structure and depth are inherently ambiguous from a single view. If we have two views, we can perceive a certain amount of depth and shape by splicing the two together. However for this to work, we need to be able to locate the same object in both pictures. 

Assuming parallel optical axes, we can define the expression for Z (depth) as: 

$$
Z=f\frac{T}{x_l-x_r}
$$
where $p$ is the world point, $(x_l-x_r)$ is the relative depth or **disparity**, $f$ is the focal length, $T$ is the baseline, and $x_l$ and $x_r$ are the image points. 

We can create a disparity map $D(x,y)$ representing the depth of the image where the maximum depth is represented with a 0 and the smallest depth is a 1.
