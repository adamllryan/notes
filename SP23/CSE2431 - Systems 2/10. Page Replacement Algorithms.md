1. Find the location of desired page on disk
2. Find a free frame
	1. If there is a free frame, use it
	2. If there is no free frame, use algorithm to select victim frame
3. Bring desired frame into newly free frame
4. Restart

The goal is to select algorithm with the lowest page-fault rate


## First in First Out
Frames are replaced in order that they are indexed in. 
Belady's Anomaly: more frames results in more page faults

## Optimal

## Least Recently Used
Chooses the least recently used frame as the victim frame. 
References a string where the least used one is selected. It can also be implemented by giving every page a counter that copies the clock every reference and the oldest reference gets replaced. 
Stack implementation - keep a stack of page numbers in double link form: 
if a page is referenced, move it to the top. 

## Second chance algorithm
needs a reference bit
clock replacement
if page to be replaced has reference bit = 1
- set reference bit to 0
- leave page in memory
- replace next page subject to same rules


## Least frequently used
replaces page with smallest count. 

## Most frequently used
replaces most frequently used under the assumption that the page with the smallest count was probably just brought in and has yet to be used.
