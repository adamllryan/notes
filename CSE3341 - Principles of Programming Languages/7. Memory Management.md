Activation Record (AR) or Stack Frame

- A stack frame is a data structure that is used to store information about the active subroutines of a computer program.
- A stack frame is a part of the call stack that is used to hold the local variables of a function, the parameters passed to a function, and the return address of the function.

Stack Frame Structure

- Return Address: The address to which the control should return when the function call is complete.
- Arguments: The parameters that are passed to the function.
- Local Variables: The variables that are declared within the function.
- Temporary Variables: The variables that are used to store intermediate results.

Stack Frame Operations

- Push: When a function is called, a new stack frame is created and pushed onto the call stack.
- Pop: When a function returns, its stack frame is popped from the call stack.

Stack Frame Example

```c
void foo(int a, int b) {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    int z = x + y;
}

void bar() {
    int p = 30;
    int q = 40;
    foo(p, q);
}

int main() {
    bar();
    return 0;
}
```

- When the main function is called, a stack frame is created for the main function.
- When the bar function is called, a stack frame is created for the bar function and pushed onto the call stack.
