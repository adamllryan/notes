## Live and Dead Objects

A live object is an object that is still being used by the program. A dead object is an object that is no longer being used by the program. The garbage collector is responsible for identifying dead objects and freeing up the memory that they occupy.

## Explicit Memory Management

We can explicitly manage memory by allocating and deallocating memory ourselves. This is done using the `new` and `delete` operators in C++.

```cpp
int* p = new int;
*p = 5;
delete p;
```

This approach is error-prone and can lead to memory leaks and dangling pointers. There is more code to maintain, requires global reasoning, but is most likely more efficient, because the programmer has more control over the runtime of the behavior of the program.

## Automatic Memory Management

This is integral for memory and type safety, and is used in languages like Java, Python, and C#. The programmer does not have to worry about memory management, as the garbage collector will automatically free up memory that is no longer being used.

In this situation, garbage collection, or automatic memory management, is not perfect, and the programmer must still remove all pointers to objects the program does not need.

## Garbage

Garbage is memory that is no longer being used by the program. The garbage collector is responsible for identifying and freeing up this memory. The garbage collector uses a variety of techniques to identify garbage, such as reference counting, mark and sweep, and generational collection.

Simply, we can say that garbage is memory that is no longer reachable or alive.

### Reference Counting

Reference counting is a simple garbage collection technique that keeps track of the number of references to an object. When the reference count drops to zero, the object is no longer being used and can be freed.

```cpp
class Object {
    int refCount;
public:
    Object() : refCount(0) {}
    void addRef() { refCount++; }
    void release() { if (--refCount == 0) delete this; }
};
```

### Mark and Sweep

Mark and sweep is a garbage collection technique that works by marking all live objects and then sweeping through the memory to free up the memory occupied by dead objects.

```cpp
void mark(Object* obj) {
    if (obj && !obj->marked) {
        obj->marked = true;
        mark(obj->next);
    }
}

void sweep(Object* obj) {
    if (obj) {
        if (obj->marked) {
            obj->marked = false;
            sweep(obj->next);
        } else {
            Object* next = obj->next;
            delete obj;
            sweep(next);
        }
    }
}
```

## Tracing

Tracing is a garbage collection technique that works by tracing through the program's memory to identify live objects. This is done by starting with the root set of objects and following references to other objects.

```cpp
void trace(Object* obj) {
    if (obj && !obj->marked) {
        obj->marked = true;
        trace(obj->next);
        trace(obj->child);
    }
}
```

Tracing garbage collection works by starting with the root set of objects and following references to other objects. This is done recursively until all live objects have been identified.

## Reachability

Reachability is a key concept in garbage collection that refers to the ability to access an object through a chain of references. If an object is reachable, it is considered live and will not be collected by the garbage collector.

Liveness under-approximates reachability, and reachability over-approximates liveness.
