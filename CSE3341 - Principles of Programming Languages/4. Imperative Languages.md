Expressions are used to generate results, and may have side effects. Statements have no value but are used for their side effects.

# Statements

## Assignment Statements

**Assignment statements** are used to assign values to a variable.
Selection, iteration, and jump statements are used to change the control flow of the program. Something like `goto` is unstructured whereas the others are not.

# Procedures

Subroutines: the general term
Procedure: subroutine that does not return a value
Function: subroutine that returns a value
Method: subroutine in some object oriented languages

# Key Concepts

An **expression** is used to generate a value from one or more operands. It may consist of constants, variables, operators, and function calls. Some of these expressions may have side effects, such as changing the state of memory.

On the other hand, a statement does not have or produce a value, but is directly used to change the state of memory, control the flow of program/execution, or hold a value. For example, an assignment statement would be used to assign a value to a variable.

Expressions are evaluated, and statements are executed.

# Expressions

Operators may be unary, binary, or, n-ary (ternary and up). Unary operators are either prefix or postfix, and binary operators may be those as well as infix. The order of operations is important in expressions, and may be controlled by parentheses (**precedence** and **associativity**).

Functions are either built-in or programmer/user-defined (think math library functions vs your own functions). These follow prefix notation, and may be used as operators in expressions. Typically, functions should not have side effects.

**Referential transparency** is the property of an expression that allows it to be replaced by its value without changing the program's behavior. This is important for optimization and parallelization. For example:

```c
x = 5; y = 1 + x++;
x = 5; y = 1 + 5;
```

We can replace the x++ with 5, and the program will behave the same. However, the resulting value of x will be different.

# Statements

Typically, we consider assignment statements and control-flow statements.

Assignment statements are used to change the value of a variable. They are typically of the form `variable = expression`. The expression is evaluated, and the result is stored in the variable.

Control-flow statements are used to change the order of execution of the program. These include selection statements (if-else, switch), iteration statements (for, while, do-while), and jump statements (break, continue, return, goto).

Unstructured control flow is considered harmful, and is really just the use of `goto`. It allows for much more complex behavior, and is difficult to understand and maintain.
Structured control flow use standard and "clean" abstractions.

## Procedures and Calls

In this course, a **subroutine** is the general term for a call. More specifically, a **procedure** is a subroutine without a return value, a **function** is a subroutine with a return value, and a **method** is a subroutine in certain object-oriented languages.

Some people like to use procedure as the general term, however we will use subroutine for this course.

Procedural languages are imperative languages where procedures are a major abstraction mechanism, such as C, Pascal, and Fortran. Reusable procedural abstraction is a collection of statements that are abstracted by name, list of formal parameters, and (optional) return values.

The basic mechanism of a procedure is defined by a caller and a callee. The caller is the statement that invokes the procedure, and the callee is the procedure itself. The caller passes the actual parameters to the callee, and the callee returns the result to the caller.

The caller will provide arguments (**actual parameters**), typically using expressions that are evaluated immediately before the call, which will be mapped to **formal parameters** in the callee.

Next, memory is allocated for the formal parameters and the local variables for the called procedure, and the control is transferred to the callee.

Finally, the callee will execute and either return to the caller or throw an exception.

# Memory Management & Lifetimes

**Static allocation** is memory whose address is determined once and retained throughout the execution of the program. Typically, global variables, static fields, local variables (languages with no recursion), static local variables, and large constants such as strings and array constants will receive statically allocated addresses.

**Stack-based allocation** is memory whose address is determined during runtime, specifically when the _procedure call_ happens. Its lifetime ends after the call ends (the procedure returns). This is used for local variables, formal parameters, and return addresses. To allocate, we push the activation record on the run-time call stack.

An **activation record** is a data structure that contains all the information needed to support a single execution of a procedure. It contains the return address, the actual parameters, the local variables, the temporary variables, and the saved machine status. Activation records may also be known as stack frames.

**Heap-based allocation** is memory whose address is determined during runtime, and its lifetime is determined by the programmer. This is used for dynamic data structures, such as linked lists, trees, and graphs. The programmer is responsible for allocating and deallocating this memory. In C, we allocate heap memory with `malloc()` and in many higher-level languages, this is abstracted into the `new` operator.

# Call Stack

When a procedure P begins its execution, an activation record is pushed onto the call stack (with space for local variables). During P's lifetime, the activation record pointer (**AP**) will contain the starting addresss of the activation record. Our stack pointer (**SP**) register contains the address of the location beyond this activation record. When P finishes, SP is reset to the current AP, and the AP is set too the address of its activation record's caller.

The program counter (**PC**) register contains the address of the next instruction to be executed. When a procedure is called, the PC is saved in the activation record, and when the procedure returns, the PC is restored from the activation record.

# Parameter Passing

**Pass-by-value** is when the actual parameter is evaluated and the value is copied into the formal parameter. This is the simplest and most common method, and is used in C, C++, Java, and C#.
**Call-by-reference** is when the actual parameter is evaluated and the address is copied into the formal parameter. This is used in C++ with the `&` operator, and in C with pointers. This is also used in Ada with the `in out` parameter mode.
