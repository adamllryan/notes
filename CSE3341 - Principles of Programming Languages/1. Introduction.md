# Spectrum

There are two main types of programming languages: imperative and declarative. **Imperative languages** (like C, Fortran, and Rust) are languages that do exactly what the programmer tells it to do. **Declarative languages**, on the other hand, handle the logic for the programmer. Essentially, the difference between imperative and declarative languages is what and how you get what you want.

Languages can be divided into four paradigms: non-object-oriented imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logic languages. Non-OO imperative languages are languages like C, Rust, and Quandry. Object-oriented languages include C++, Java, and C#. Functional languages include Lisp, Scheme, and ML. Logic languages include Datalog and Prolog.

# Implementation

How do we implement programming languages? We can do so via compilation or interpretation.

Compilation takes the source program and "compiles" it into machine code such that the OS can run it.

Interpretation is where we have a compiled program (the interpreter) that takes the source code and can interpret/run our source program.

Either your source program is compiled into an executable or an executable "interpreter" takes your source code and runs it.
