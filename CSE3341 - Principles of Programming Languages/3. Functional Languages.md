# Immutable Quandary
**Immutable Quandary** is the default Quandary program when you don't add the `mutable` keyword. It disallows variable and heap mutation and only supports integer and reference types (`int` and `Ref`). In this case, the `Q` type is the supertype of integers and references. These are **static** types, so they are checked at compile time. 
#### Static Checking Rules
In Quandary, we check for the following rules before runtime:
- Integer constant *must* have `int` type.
- `nil` has `ref` type.
- `<expr1> . <expr2>` must return `ref` type and operands are `Q` type.
- Built-in functions `left(v)` and `right(v)` take in `ref` types and return `Q` types.
- Explicit downcasts are required (`left((Ref)right(<expr>)`).
#### Dynamic Checking Rules
At runtime, a `ref` type expression evaluating into an `int` type will result in an error and vice versa. Similarly, 
At runtime, the following situations will result in an error:
- `Ref` type expression evaluates to `int` type.
- `int` type expression evaluates to `Ref` type. 
- Calling the built-in functions `left(nil)` and `right(nil)` will fail.
# Lists
A list does not exist in Quandary. However, we can invent it by using the dot operator, nested. For example, the list $[1,2,3,4,5]$ can be represented in Quandary as `(1.(2.(3.(4.(5.nil)))))`.
