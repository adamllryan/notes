# Immutable Quandary
This is any quandary program without the `mutable` keyword. It disallows variable and heap mutation, and only supports integer and reference types (`int` and `Ref`). In this case, the `Q` type is the super type of integers and references. These are **static** types, so they are checked at compile time. 

At runtime, the following situations will result in an error:
- `Ref` type expression evaluates to `int` type.
- `int` type expression evaluates to `Ref` type. 
- Left and right `nil` fail at runtime.
