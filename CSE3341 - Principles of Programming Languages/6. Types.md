## Types

We organize _untyped values_ into bit strings and categorize them based on usage and behavior. A **type** is a set of computational entities with uniform behavior. We add constraints to types to enforce correctness and normalcy.

## Static Typing

A statically typed language is a language with expressions that have static types.
