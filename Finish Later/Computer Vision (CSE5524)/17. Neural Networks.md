## Feed-Forward

A **feed-forward** neural network takes inputs and passes them through layers of neurons to produce an output.

Neural networks are composed of **nodes** (units), and each node is connected by links between other nodes, inputs, and output nodes. A link has a numeric **weight** associated with it which serves as its means of long-term storage/memory.

The weighted sum of the previous outputs and their links' weights are considered a neuron's **activation level**.

## Backpropagation

Let's pretend we have fixed inputs in our network. What can we change to make our error smaller? The weights. Let's remove this assumption. Let's now make the assumption that the current layer we are on is correct, and the error comes from behind. To make our answer better, we have to adjust the layer before!
