How is an image formed?
A camera collects light from a lens, which is measured by the image array that turns them into a digital signal. A frame grabber then grabs that signal and transfers it to memory.

## Image Sensor

The charged coupled device was the original digital sensor, and would take a large surface on a chip, which would collect and convert photons that hit it into a small charge. The downside of this is that noise is directly correlated with how fast we can take images.

The "coupled" part of the name refers to the second segment of the sensor, which is responsible for reading the color and image from the chip. This needs to read every pixel in sequential order. Because light does not stop hitting the chip, we need a physical, discrete shutter to block light while reading.

CMOS is more common today because they include amplifier circuits. Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor uses transistors in each pixel to amplify and move the charge. This is more flexible because each pixel can be read individually, and uses a rolling shutter strategy. Normally, CMOS has more noise, lower light sensitivity, and consumes little power. It is also cheaper.
