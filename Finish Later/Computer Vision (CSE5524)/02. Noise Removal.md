## Local Pixel Neighborhoods

Typically, we deal with images on a pixel-by-pixel basis. For each pixel, we check the neighbors around it.

To start, we can consider 4 and 8-connected pixel regions. We can consider the 4 closest neighbors, to the top, bottom, left, and right of our target, or also include the diagonals to get 8-pixel neighbors.

## Noise

Images can be noisy. Different sensors can have different noise and distortion properties. We want to filter images to enhance, reduce noise, and emphasize or suppress certain image details. We typically decide what to do with a pixel using local pixel regions, or neighborhoods.

Our first and simplest removal of noise is binary image noise ("salt and pepper").

In this case, we have only black and white pixels, so we can check every pixel and change the value of pixels to match its neighbors if there are enough of them. When we do this, we want to save the result to a _new_ image, because that could cause problems.

What about non-binary values? Using the mean can cause outliers to affect values.

We can use median filtering to choose a middle value WITHOUT inventing a new number! We notice that with mean filtering, edges are often destroyed. Using median filtering is better at preserving edges, but it is also a higher cost because we need to sort every pixel value.

## Filter Masks

Convolution and correlation in image processing. A mask is a set of pixel positions and corresponding values or weights. A mask has an origin, normally the top-left corner or center. It takes the shape of a neighborhood, except we define the structure of it and the weights of each pixel.

For example, **average** filtering smooths over a local region by replacing a pixel with the average pixel value for the box around it. This is also known as a smoothing mask. With a smoothing mask, the sum of all the weights should equal 1 and each weight should be positive, and the amount of smoothing is proportional to the size of the mask (bigger masks smooth more).

Gaussian smoothing is similar to mean smoothing, except that the weight of the pixels is higher the closer we are to the center pixel.

In 2-D, it appears to be symmetric. With Gaussian smoothing, $\sigma$ controls the spread of the function. Normally, we use $2\sigma$ within the mask because it can cover 95% of the total weight.

Think of high-frequency changes as what gets picked up in edge-detection. It is the edges of an image where rapid changes occur, so that's what gets picked up. Gaussian filtering is good at removing those high-frequency areas.

**Anisotropic Filtering** is a method to smooth an image while preserving boundaries and structures of interest. The main idea is to use edge detection and then adjust smoothing to be lower around those areas.

## Separability of Filters

Because using two filters in a row run in $O(N^2 \cdot n^2)$ complexity, we reduce this by using multiple 1-D filters that iterate by row and then column to reduce it to $O(N^2 \cdot n)$ complexity.

We can also separate 2-D Gaussians into two 1-D Gaussians. Median filter is not separable.
