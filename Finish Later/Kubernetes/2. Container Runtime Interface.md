Container Runtime Interface (CRI) is an interface that allows any vendor, not just Docker, use Kubernetes' as an orchestrator. It uses Open Container Initiative (OCI) as a standard:

- Imagespec: how an image should be build
- Runtimespec: how any container runtime should be developed

Use crictl to debug containers
```
crictl
crictl pull <image>
crictl images
crictl ps -a
crictl exec -I -t <> ls
crictl logs <>
crictl pods
```
