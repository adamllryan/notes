Kubernetes does not deploy containers directly in nodes; instead, containers are deployed into a Pod, which is a special object within a node that encapsulates a container. Typically, pods and containers have a one-to-one relationship, where when we need another instance of a container, we create a new pod.

However, we can add multiple containers into one pod. In this case, the containers should not be of the same kind, and usually are helper containers. Containers in the same pod share the same storage space and can communicate directly with each other by calling localhost, since they are within the same virtual network.

In short, a pod should contain different containers that work together to achieve a goal, and scaling that application works by creating copies of that pod.
