# Methodologies
## Lean
**Lean** is a set of principles that aims to maximize value and minimize waste. In this, code trimmings are prioritized as much as code additions. 

## Kanban
**Kanban** is a methodology based on Lean and Agile that categorizes tasks through a visualized workflow. It typically uses a Kanban board, which categorizes task progress into "stages", which are commonly labelled as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". On Kanban boards, each task is placed into a card that moves through each stage as it progresses. 

## Scrum
**Scrum** shares some concepts with Kanban, but focuses on fixed-length "sprints", which are standard periods of time, such as 2 weeks. There is typically a scrum master who is in charge of the operation and within a sprint, the focus should not be changed. 

# The Seven Wastes
Lean's goal is to eliminate anything that doesn't add value and only work on the most necessary tasks. Everything else is considered "waste". Lean focuses on 7 waste categories:

- **Partially Done Work**: any work that is incomplete (a.k.a. WIP).
- **Extra Features**: Unused features that don't bring customer value (overproduction). 
- **Relearning**: Relearning solutions that have been previously solved. Document solutions to prevent time wastes. 
- **Hand-offs**: Minimize hand-offs between employees because this wastes time. 
- **Task-switching**: Minimize jumping between different projects.
- **Delays**: Anything that delays time. 
- **Defects**: Avoid creating defects in code because this wastes time. 

# Value Stream Mapping

**Value stream maps** are visual representations of key steps within a process. We can use these to analyze periods of time that produce unnecessary waste. 

# Identifying and Eliminating Waste
1. Discuss issues.
2. Complete a value stream map on issues.
3. Complete a root cause analysis.
4. Identify and prioritize potential solutions.
5. Experiment with solutions and check results.

# Kaizen
**Kaizen** is a lean tool that improves quality, productivity, safety, and workplace culture. It follows the cycle of *plan*, *do*, *check*, *act*. This essentially is a cycle of continuous improvement. 

# Summary
1. Don't bother squeezing features that aren't necessary.
2. Be mindful to what may be wasteful and not critical to release.
3. Sometimes there is required waste (legal, regulatory, documentation). 
4. Squads near you will suffer from the same waste issues, so removing them will help all.
