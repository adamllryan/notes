# Budget
Having a concept of what is coming in and coming out; planning expenses. Separated into four groups:
- Essentials, such as housing, loans, etc.
- Non-essentials, such as fun spending and shopping.
- Short-term savings, like saving for a trip.
- Long-term savings, such as retirement.
Split your money into 50% essentials, 15% retirement, 5% savings.

- 10% Credit Mix, mix of cards, debt, loans, etc.
- 10% New Credit, opening new credit lines lowers score. 
# Debt

1. Build an emergency fund.
2. Contribute up to the match on your 401(k)
3. Pay off high-interest credit cards
4. Pay off private student loans
5. Contribute even more to your 401(k)

# Invest
Ordered from low to high risk, you can invest in cash, bonds/fixed income, and stocks(equities)/international stocks. Be careful to diversify, go for multiple types.
# Retire
