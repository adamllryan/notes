# Databases
A **database** is a collection of similar data built for a specific purpose. It is *logically coherent*, meaning data is connected in a rational, logical manner. The data must have an *inherent meaning* such that the data as a whole can be described. For example, a set of data could be considered a collection of customers if it contains all the data about a customer. Finally, it must serve a *specific purpose*. 

A **database management system**, or more specifically a *relational DBMS*, is software used to manage and access data. It is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a database. It can be accessed by [[Application Program|application programs]], or programs written by the developer. 

Using a database approach comes with the advantages of:
- Controlled redundancy
- Controlled access
- Efficient query and update processing
- Backups
- Enforcing constraints
- Enforcing standards
- Reduced application development time
- Flexibility
- Instant updates to information

However, there is a lot of overhead when it comes to databases. It requires more hardware, software, security, and levels of control that often aren't free. 

We shouldn't use a DBMS when:
- We only have one user
- There is limited data manipulation
- Speed is more important
- Requirements will never change
- We have limited storage capacity

Databases should be 
a. Self describing
b. Insulate between programs and data, data abstraction
c. Support multiple views of data
d. Allow for sharing of data and multi-user transaction processing
# Database System
A database system contains a complete definition of structure and constraints. It contains **metadata**, which describes the structure of the database, and a **database catalog**, which is used by DBMS software and users who need information about the database structure. 

In the first level, we have the [[Application Program|application program]], which is where the actual program is. The application program may access the DBMS software, where it uses query process software to translate queries to commands, which are sent to data access software. This final program is attached to the metadata and database segment, which handles getting the data back.

Some other important structures are: 
- database schema, or the description of the database. 
- schema diagram, which displays selected aspects of the schema. 
- schema construct, or each object in the schema. 
- database state/snapshot, or the data in the database at a particular moment in time. 

The purpose of a DBMS is to provide insulation between programs and data. Middleman software that has the same method of access between any program as long as the data needs to be the same. **DATA ABSTRACTION, PROGRAM-DATA INDEPENDENCE, MUTABLE**

The standard architecture is a three-tier client-server system architecture. Built out of Client (Web interface and GUI), Application Server (Application Programs and Backend processing and Web pages), and Database Server (DBMS, SQLite, SQL, Microsoft, etc.).

Abstraction allows for support of multiple views of the data. Allows access restriction and is a subset of the database. 

A **view** is a subset of the database, and it contains virtual data derived from the database's files. That data is not (explicitly) stored and allows for a level of access restriction. It also allows us to implement multi-user DBMSes. 
# Three Schema Architecture
The **three-schema architecture** promotes program-data independence. It supports multiple views of the data and each level provides mappings to levels above and below. 

The first view is the **external view level**. It describes the part of the database that a particular user group is interested in. The external view level is tailored to end user groups and hides parts of the database that the user should not have access to or need. 

Next, the **conceptual level** describes the structure of the whole database for a community of users. It hides the details of physical storage and entails the [[2. Entity Relationship Model|entities]], [[2. Entity Relationship Model|relationships]], and [[0002. Entity Relationship Model|constraints]]. It is usually the level where the database is actually designed and implemented. 

Finally, the **internal level** is the level that describes and handles the physical storage structure of the database. 

# Requirements
In order to design a database, we need to collect the requirements and constraints needed for our database. We need to:
1. Identify the users. 
2. Find the facts, like information, queries, maintenance, and constraints. 
3. Analyze and write a report.

First, our users are typically:
- End users who are naive or sophisticated, and
- non-end users, like management, technical, executive, etc. 

We need to validate the database for **validation** and **verification**. Are we building the right model and are we building the model right?

We can find the facts via questionnaires, reports, forms, interviews, observing business processes and workflows, and conducting Joint App Design sessions. 

Then, once the data is collected, we can determine who is accessing the database, how they will use it, and what information it has to hold. We can finally build it now!
