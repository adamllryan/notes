**Entity-relationship** models are helpful for conceptualizing the real world. They show a simple and static memory of a system. Here is how to build one.

We have a few types of items in an ER model. An **entity** is a thing that exists. It can be represented with a *rectangle*, like this: 
![[Entity.png]]
An **attribute** is dependent on an entity. It represents a value attached to an entity. For example, if we have the entity Student, an attribute could be a letter grade. It is *circled*.

A **relationship** is denoted as a *diamond*. It links entities together and shows that they can be related in some way.

A **key attribute** is an attribute that uniquely identifies an entity. It can be differentiated from normal attributes because the text is *underlined*. 

If an attribute has one part, it is **atomic**, or **simple**. If it stores more than one part, it is called **composite**. We represent this by having a parent attribute then child values linked to the base attribute. 

Similarly a **multivalued** attribute is denoted with a *double-circle* if it can store more than one value. For example, if a person entity can have multiple emails, we would use a multivalued attribute to store them. 

**Derived** attributes are not stored, but calculated. They are put in a *dotted-circle*. 

# ER Model
We can represent an ER Model with just the above, but it would not be very descriptive. Sometimes, we need to restrict interactions between entities, so we used constraints to do so. 

**Cardinality** is the idea of constraining one or both sides of the relationship. With it, we can denote one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships. On the relationship lines, we write a 1 and M to denote their respective values. If we have a many-to-many, we try to use one M and one N to show that they aren't dependent on each other. 

A single line represents optional relationship, where we can have zero to the number placed on the line of relationships. A double line is a total participation relationship, where there must be that many relationships between that entity and the other side. 

**Weak entities** are drawn as a double box, and only exist by being related to another entity. Their key is a **partial key**, which is dotted underlined. It must have a total participation constraint attached. 

Here is a summary of the notation:

The constraint notation above is called the **Chen** notation. An alternative notation is to not use the double lines, and instead represent both sides with an interval (min, max). 

Relationships of higher degrees may exist, too. While most relationships have a degree of 2 (binary), we sometimes have **ternary** or **n-ary** relationships. These are often problematic, though, because - what do they mean? We don't know. 

# UML
**UML** is an alternative notation. It uses **classes** to describe entities. Classes have three sections:
- class name. 
- attributes. 
- methods. 
UML is a more software development oriented modeling language. It uses a similar relationship structure to the above, except relationships are replaced with just the name label. 

# Schema Naming
We want to maximize the usefulness of our schemas. In order to do so, we should follow these naming constructs:
- Choose names that convey meanings. 
- Choose Nouns that give rise to entity type names. 
- Choose Verbs that indicate names of relationship types. 
- Choose binary relationship names making it readable left to right and top to bottom.
