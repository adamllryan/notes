We have 3 approaches to accessing a [[database]] in our programs: 
1. Use a library
2. Use plaintext
3. Make a new language like PL/SQL

# Typical Operation
1. Client opens a connection to the [[database]]. 
2. Client submits queries. 
3. Client closes connection.

Databases and datatypes must have a *binding*. 
They also must have a method of *iterating* over results. 

# SQL Injection
