An **abstract state** is a modification of state, where we map $\sigma_a$ from variables to abstract values. An abstract variable is a summarization of many possible concrete states, meaning a certain will hold one of those possible values within the range of that variable type. For example, we use:
$\sigma_a:\text{Vars}\mapsto\{\text{NegInt},\text{ZeroInt},\text{PosInt},\text{AnyInt}\}$ where $\text{Vars}$ is the set of all variable names in the program. These all are integers, but restrict the sign value to its respective range.


With loops, merging infinite number of states $\sigma_{ak}$ is a problem. Instead, we can fix this somehow by doing it iteratively, where we begin with state $\sigma'_{a0}$:
