# Untyped Values
The lowest level representation of anything, a sequence of bits. We can't really do much with this, so we try to assign them higher-level views (types).

# Type
A set of run-time values with uniform behavior.

## Type-related Constraints
A method of enforcing correctness.

For example:
- Do not multiply two strings.
- Do not use a character as a condition.
- Do not use an integer as a pointer.

## Static Types
A promise of possible runtime values. It may be declared or inferred. Basically, it says that variables will have a certain type. 
### Statically-Typed Language
A language that uses static types for variables. Such as C, C++, Java, ML, Pascal, etc.

## Dynamic Types
States that entities in code do not need to have static types. Such as Lisp, Scheme, Perl, Python, etc.
### Dynamic Type Checking
Before an operation is performed but after the program begins, check that types are correct before performing an operation.
