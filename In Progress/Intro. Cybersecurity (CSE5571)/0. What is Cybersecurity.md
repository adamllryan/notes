# Cybersecurity
**Cybersecurity** is the concept of maintaining computer or information security. **Hacking**, or penetration by unauthorized users, is an example of a digital attack, and may be performed via usage of malware, ransomware, or [[08_security#Security Risks|denial of service]] attacks (DoS/DDOS). These attacks can be prevented or defended against by using access control systems, firewalls, and cryptographic tools. However, even the most secure systems might be penetrated via human exploits, such as insider threats, social engineering, and phishing. Even physical exploits such as natural disasters can become an attack surface under the right conditions. 

## Definitions
**CISA** defines cybersecurity as the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. 

**NIST** defines cybersecurity as the prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communication services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its **availability**, **integrity**, **authentication**, **confidentiality**, and **nonrepudiation**.
