# The Internet
#### Network
Two or more computing devices connected together. 
#### Internet
The global network of **inter**connected **net**works. It provides best-effort (not necessarily reliable) delivery of packets between connected hosts
## Connection Methodologies
#### Circuit Switching
The original connection method (widely used with landlines). Every connection using this is dedicated to a pair of nodes. 
#### Packet Switching
What the [[4. Network Security#Internet|Internet]] is based on. Originally thought to be not achievable, we now use this to run the entire Internet. This protocol packs information into packets and routes (or forwards) them between devices within a [[4. Network Security#Network|network]].
##### Packets
A structured sequence of bytes consisting of a header and payload:
- **header**: metadata used by the network protocol.
- **payload**: they actual user data/information being transported.
##### IP Address
The unique identifier held by each host in a network. This allows hosts to find other hosts and know who to send information to.
## Network Layers
We use network layers to abstract data between transportation. 
#### OSI Model
More concisely, we use the **OSI** network stack:
- **Application**: communication between applications
- Presentation
- Session
- **Transport**: provides reliable connection (TCP) and in order delivery
- **Network**: forwards/routes the packets from source to destination
- **Link**: delivers packet across a single link to the next hop
- **Physical**: delivers stream of bits across a physical medium between nodes
#### TCP/IP Model
The TCP/IP model simplifies this model:
- Application: HTTP,FTP,SMTP between applications
- Transport: TCP, reliable connection
- Internet: IP, packet across the internet
- Link: Packet across a single link
- Physical: Bit stream across a physical connection
# Protocols
Here are the most frequently used network protocols:
![[Pasted image 20241101154921.png]]
#### Network Layer: IP
Delivers IP packets from a source to destination using IP address information left in the packet headers. Comes in two *versions*:

**IPv4**: 32-bit host addresses, allowing for 2^32 unique addresses. This is a problem because we have more users than this. Written as XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX where each XXX represents 4 bytes.
**IPv6**: 128-bit host addresses, solving the problem of IPv4.

*Relevant Terms*:
- **IP Addressing**: to assign each host a unique address.
- **IP Routing**: act of hosts and routers trying to forward packets to a destination address.
- **Dotted Quad**: one XXX in an IPv4 address.
- **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)**: manages IP address space.

> 
> IP provides **routing**, **addressing**, and **fragmentation reassembly**. It does not provide ordering, retransmission, acknowledgement, error checking, or security.
>  

##### Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
Responsible for developing premiere standards for the Internet. Produces voluntary standards that are often adopted by Internet users, network operators, and equipment vendors. Also develops *IPvX*.

*Relevant Terms*:
- Request for Comments (**RFC**), the name for IETF technical documentation
- **STD** Internet Standards: Subtype of RFC
- **BCP** Best Current Practices in the Internet: Subtype of RFC

##### IPv4 Header
Contains important metadata about the payload being transmitted. 

**Checksum**: 16-bit header checksum of the header only, protecting it against channel noise. If it is incorrect, the router or host drops the packet.
**Time-to-live (TTL)**: 8-bit number where for every route, the TTL is decreased and dropped after 0. 
**Destination Address**: 32-bit IP address of the intended recipient.
**Source Address**: 32-bit IP address of the sender. (this can be faked)
##### IPv6 Header
Here is the IPv6 header (left) vs. the IPv4 header (right). 
![[Pasted image 20241101165137.png]]
*Changes* from IPv4 to IPv6:
- Major simplification.
- '**Checksum**' has been removed.
- '**TTL**' renamed to '**Hop Limit**'.
- '**Protocol**' is now '**Version**'.

#### Transport Layer
These protocols are responsible for ensuring data makes it between hosts.
##### Network Ports
Each application on a host is identified by a 16-bit **port number**. Certain protocols use default ports.
##### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
Provides a reliable stream of bytes between two application's ports. IP does not guarantee that packets will arrive, not corrupt, and arrive in order. TCP handles retransmissions and reordering packets such that they appear correctly and in order.

A TCP *Header* contains:
- Source port
- Destination port
- Sequence number
- Acknowledgement number
- Offset
- Flags
- Checksum
- etc.

*Features*:
- Requests re-transmissions.
- Rearranges mis ordered packets.
- Tries to reduce network congestion.

*Three Way Handshake*:
- Connection sequence where both hosts agree on a port. 
- Hosts send each other a sequence number and acknowledge by returning the number plus one before transmitting data.

##### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
Provides a simple stream of bytes when we care more about latency than dropping packets.

##### Domain Name System (DNS)
Utilized by users and the application layer to navigate the Internet. It is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system that maps host names to IP addresses. A query travels between a series of different resolution servers to try and find the matching IP to the given host name query. 

*Terms*:
- **Host name**: The user/application layer read name to be translated.

#### Link Layer: Ethernet
Allows sending a frame (wrapper around a packet) to other local hosts. Devices are identified by a Media Access Control (**MAC**) Address, which is a 48-bit unique address given by the manufacturer and is tied to the network interface controller (**NIC**).

![[Pasted image 20241101180626.png]]

While an IP address (logical) may change over time or when you change networks, a MAC address (physical) is tied to the hardware and will never change. The router is responsible for managing a MAC Address Table that maps MACs to an IP.

An Ethernet *frame* contains:
- Source Mac Address
- Destination Mac Address
- Type
- Payload
- Checksum
##### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
Uses IPv4 to map IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses. A host broadcasts an ARP packet to entire LAN network with an IP address, hoping that address will reply with its MAC address.
##### Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
The IPv6 version of ARP.

![[Pasted image 20241102163711.png]]
# Network Architecture
The design of a computer network, comprised of:
- devices such as computers, hubs, switches, routers, repeaters, bridges, etc.
- cables, connectors, etc.
- layout and topology
- software and protocols

*Network topology*: the size of the network, meaning LAN vs. MAN vs. WAN, or the connection pattern of the network:

![[Pasted image 20241102164139.png]]
#### Devices
**Repeater**
Regenerates the signals over the same network. It simply improves the signal to noise ratio. A physical layer device.
**Hub**
A repeater with multiple ports. Repeats all bits to all connected devices. A physical layer device.
**Switch**
Forwards and filters frames based on a MAC address. Only sends to ports that have the matching IP address, unless they don't know the port. A link layer device.
**Router**
An internetworking device that forwards packets between networks. Operates at the internet & network layer, using routing protocols to discover and maintain routes. 

*Definitions*:
- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): protocol used by a router
**Wireless Router**
A wireless access point integrated with a router.
**Wireless Access Point (WAP)**
creates a wireless LAN using Wi-Fi
# Network Security
Has two goals:
- protect the computer systems connected to the network, including the information stored in these systems. 
- protect the information transmitted over the network.
## Vulnerabilities
### Unencrypted Transmission
All ethernet, IP, UDP, TCP is not encrypted, making it possible to eavesdrop during forwarding.
### No Source Authentication
It is possible to spoof a user's identity and avoid being traced.
### No Encrypted Integrity Checking
Checksums are not encrypted meaning entire packets can be altered without detection.
### No Bandwidth Constraints
Possible to inject a large number of packets into the network and blow it up (denial of service). 
## Attacks and Defenses
**Sniffing Attacks**
- Intercepting network packets using an application such as *Wireshark*. Same idea as tapping or bugging phone lines.
- Passive sniffing listens to everything sent by a hub, and can be defended from by using a switch instead of a hub.
- An active sniffing attack is MAC Flooding Attack spams MAC addresses until the CAM table is full so that the switch behaves like a hub.
- Another is MAC spoofing, where some devices can change MAC addresses. 
**ARP Spoofing/Poisoning**
We can spoof ARP by replying to who requests with a different MAC address. It may result in replacing a MAC with your spoofed one. 
This is defendable partially by forcing read-only entries for critical services such as the router info, etc. 
We are also able to use authenticated encryption at a different layer , network monitoring, and using a vpn.
**IP Spoofing**
A simple attack where we fake the source address of an IP header with a different one. Defend against this by packet filtering and not using IP-based encryption
**DNS Caching**
Replacing cached IP addresses with spoofed ones. Defend by using DNSSEC (DNS security extensions). 
**Denial-of-Service**
Forcing a computer to become unavailable to its intended users by spamming it or sending hard to reply messages with fake packets to overwhelm it. 
- SYN Flooding: Spam 3 way handshake SYNC messages in TCP. 
- Amplification: Use other servers to send a request that becomes larger. 
- Botnets: Infect IoT devices with malware to produce a DDoS attack

## Defense in Depth
Requires a multilayered approach.
![[Pasted image 20241102180248.png]]
## Firewall
A network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic and decides whether to allow or block that traffic defined by a set of security rules. Sits at the gateway between two networks. 
![[Pasted image 20241102180528.png]]
A network firewall separates an individual network from the internet and a host firewall does the same for an individual host. 

*Why?*
- Allows only authorized access to the inside network.
- Prevents illegal access to internal data.
- Prevents illegal modification of internal data.
- Prevents attacks launched from hosts on the Internet.
- Provides bandwidth control.
- Provides network usage control.

*How?*
- All traffic must pass through this firewall.
- The firewall should not be compromised.

### Packet Filtering Firewalls
Simply filters one IP packet at a time based on source and destination addresses, direction, and protocol (and port). 
![[Pasted image 20241102181113.png]]
*How?*
Uses **static rules** based on an **access control list (ACL)**.

### Stateful Inspection Firewalls
also known as dynamic packet filtering, manage the same as a packet filtering firewall, but also manage a state table to manage connections. 

*How?*
- Keeps a **state table** to track TCP connections and block any that do not follow active connections.

![[Pasted image 20241102181828.png]]
### Application-Level Gateway/Proxy Firewall
Also looks into application layer information.
![[Pasted image 20241102183231.png]]
### Demilitarization Zone (DMZ)
Used by enterprise networks, where devices in the DMZ are blocked from communicating with the inside network unless returning a response. 
![[Pasted image 20241102183401.png]]
*Other Terms*:
- Circuit-Level Gateways
- Name Address Translation
- Unified Threat Management
- Distributed Firewalls
- Next-Generation Firewalls

## Intrusion Detection
The idea of detecting intruders.

*Terms*:
- **False positive**: no real intrusion, but declared intrusion.
- **False negative**: intrusion but not detected. 
### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
also known as prevention system (IPS), are devices or software applications that monitor a network for malicious activities or other policy violations.
### NIDS
Placed behind the firewall, inside the network. Provides deep packet inspection at the entrance of the network. 
### Signature-based Detection
Learns attack signatures, marking traffic that matches the signatures as suspicious.
### Anomaly-based Detection
Learns normal network traffic and flags different traffic.

# Transport Layer Security (TLS)
aka **SSL/TLS**, **TLS/SSL**.

Adds security to any TCP-based application. It is known as secure communication in action, and is open sourced by the OpenSSL project.

*Provides*:
- Confidentiality via bulk encryption (AES)
- Integrity via message authentication (HMAC or AES-GCM)
- Source Authentication via digital certificates, digital signatures, and public key infrastructure

*Terms*:
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
Known as the **backbone of Internet and Web Security**, and is divided into two parts:
#### TLS Protocol
Requires four separate algorithms:
- Key exchange with authentication/digital signatures
- Bulk encryption
- Message authentication (MAC)
-   ???

#### Digital Certificates
A small data file used to authenticate the identity of a server.

*Contains*:
- Subject Name
- Issuer Name
- Validity Dates
- Known Subdomains
- **Public key**
- More Info
- Trust reasons
- [[Digital Signature]]

*How to Obtain*:
- Do not self-sign.
- Obtain from a certificate authority (third-party).

#### Public Key Infrastructure
A set of organizations, policies, and procedures needed to:
- generate, distribute, store, and revoke digital certificates
- manage public-key encryption

Establishes trust, authentication, confidentiality, and integrity.

#### TLS Handshake
Follows these steps:
1. **Protocol Agreement**, where the client and server agree on TLS version.
2. **Cipher Suite Negotiation**, where they specify which cryptographic algorithm to use.
3. **Server Authentication**, where client requests digital certificate to authenticate identity of the server.
4. **Session Key Exchange**, where they use asymmetric encryption to generate session keys.

#### Cipher Suite
The suite of ciphers used by TLS

Key Exchange: RSA, DHE_RSA, ECDHE_RSA
Bulk Encryption: AES, CHACHA-20, Camelia
Message Authentication: HMAC or AES-GCM

*Terms*:
- **Client write key**: client key for bulk encrypting messages (AES)
- **Server write key**: server key for bulk encrypting messages (AES)
- **Client write MAC key**: client key for message authentication (AES)
- **Server write MAC key**: server key for message authentication (AES) 
- **MAC**: Message Authentication Code
# QUIC
TLS alternative when using UDP, developed by Google.
# IPSec
Network layer protocol suite and IETF Standard. Recommended for IPv6 and backward compatible with IPv4.

*Provides*:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Data origin authentication

*Uses*:
- Symmetric encryption
- MAC
- Key Exchange
- Authentication

*Security*:
Authentication Header Protocol
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) Protocol
Key Exchange Protocol

## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
Extends a private network across a public network, providing **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authentication**. Can be implemented in TLS, link layer, or application layer, but most popular way is to use IPSec. 

## Transport Mode
IPSec's first mode. Only the **payload** of IP packet is encrypted, allowing intermediate nodes to read source and destination addresses. IP header can be authenticated with a MAC to prevent spoofing and replay attacks.

## Tunnel Mode
Encrypts or authenticates the **entire** IP packet. The packet is enclosed in a new packet with new header. VPNs use this approach.

## Authentication Header Protocol
Provides source authentication, data integrity, but no confidentiality by inserting authentication header into the IP packets between header and payload.
![[Pasted image 20241103160953.png]]
## Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
Provides source authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality by placing payload between ESP header and ESP authentication field.
![[Pasted image 20241103161128.png]]
# Wireless Security
## Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
Wireless security protocol.

**WPA** is broken.
**WPA2** does not require encryption.
**WPA3** (2020) mandates at least AES-128 in CCM mode.

# Web Security
The ability to safely browse the web and run secure web apps.

## World Wide Web (WWW)
The global collection of documents/resources, linked by hyperlinks and accessed using HTTP/S.

*Terms*:
- Web page: a hypertext document written in HTML.
- Website: a collection of web pages and other web resources.
- Web Browser: enables access to web resources.

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Application layer protocol for fetching web resources from a web server.

![[Pasted image 20241103164733.png]]

*How*:
1. User initiates a request aimed at the server.
2. Server responds with the requested resource.
3. End transaction.

![[Pasted image 20241103164907.png]]
## JavaScript
A programming language that adds interactivity to a website. Able to interact with local hardware, create additional requests, manipulate the page, and more.
## Browser Cookies
Locally saved website data that serves as a website state for repeat visits.

*Used for*:
- Session management (logins, shopping carts, scores, etc.)
- Personalization (preferences, themes, etc.)
- Tracking (recording and analyzing user behavior (privacy concern!!!))

### Session Hijacking Attack
When an attacker steals the cookie of an existing session to use it as if they were the authenticated user.

Prevent this by setting the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` attribute on the cookie.

A **session cookie** deletes when the current session ends but only if the browser doesn't restore it on boot.

**Permanent cookies** are deleted after a specified time.

## Same-Origin Policy (SOP)
A website should not be able to access/affect the session of another website.

*Rules*:
- Same-Origin Policy: Resources from one origin cannot read or modify resources from another origin.
- Same origin: uses the same scheme/protocol, host, and port.

### Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
When an attacker injects scripting code such as JavaScript into pages generated by a web application. Occurs when untrusted data is taken and not properly validated/sanitized.
