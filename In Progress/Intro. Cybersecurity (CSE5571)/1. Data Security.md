# Information Security, the CIA Triad
The **CIA** triad of information security is **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**. 
![[Pasted image 20240828204646.png|300]]
## CIA Triad
### Confidentiality
Confidentiality is roughly equivalent to keeping information secret or private. It ensures that only users or systems with the rights, privileges, and the need to know have access to information. According to NIST, **confidentiality** means reserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. 
### Integrity
**Integrity** mean whole, complete, and uncorrupted. According to NIST, integrity involves guarding against improper information modification or destruction and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity. 

We can use cryptography as means for providing integrity, as well. It involves preventing unauthorized individuals from modifying data but does not necessarily imply confidentiality. For example, if we download a software update, we don't care that the download is confidential, however we want to ensure that none of the files have been modified to include malicious code. 
### Availability
NIST: **availability** requires ensuring timely and reliable access to systems and information. For example, we encounter **denial of service attacks** that prevent authorized individuals from accessing required data and **ransomware** that prevents users from accessing their own files unless a ransom is paid. Best practice to protect against these attacks include regular backups, off-site data storage, routine maintenance and upgrades, adequate communication bandwidth, and business continuity/disaster recovery plans.

## Other Aspects
### Authenticity
**Authentication** is the process of verifying the claimed identity of a user, process, or device. According to NIST, authenticity is a security measure to protect against acceptance of fraudulent transmission by establishing the validity of a transmission, message, or originator. While integrity ensures that the message was not altered, authenticity ensures that the message has come from the right person.

### Non-repudiation
**Non-repudiation** is the assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender's identity, so neither can later deny having processed the information. For example, a notary may provide non-repudiation while digital signatures provide the digital version of this. 

### Accountability
NIST states that **accountability** is the property that ensures that the actions of an entity may be traced uniquely to that entity, supporting non-repudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention, after-action recovery, and legal action. Data logs are one such example that can provide this. 

## Important Definitions
An **asset** is a resource that we are protecting. Assets may be logical or physical. 

A **vulnerability** is a potential weakness in an asset or its defensive control systems such as a software defect, unprotected system port, or an unlocked door. 

**Exposures** refer to the state of being exposed. An exposure exists when a vulnerability is known to an attacker. 

An **exploit** is a technique used to compromise a system such as a script used by an attacker. An exploit is a defined way to breach the security of a system through a vulnerability.

A **threat** is an event on circumstance that has the potential to adversely affect operations and assets.

An **attack** is an intentional act that can damage or otherwise compromise information, such as an intruder attempting to break into an information system. 

**Loss** is an instance of an asset suffering damage or destruction, unauthorized modification or disclosure, or denial of use.

**Risk** is the probability of an unwanted occurrence such as an adverse event or loss. 

**Control**, **safeguard**, or **countermeasure** refers to security mechanisms policies, or procedures that can successfully counter attacks, reduce risk, resolve vulnerabilities, and otherwise improve security. 

**Risk management** is the process of identifying vulnerabilities and potential threats, assessing their risk, and deciding what countermeasures, if any, to take in order to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. It is essentially the process of balancing the risk with the cost of countermeasures and value of assets. 

# Data Security & Cryptography
**Data** is any sequence of symbols, letters, numbers and binary symbols. **Information** is organized and structured data that provides additional knowledge, worth, and usefulness. Further, **information theory** defines information as the resolution of uncertainty. While data and information are used interchangeably, data is not the same as information. Encrypted data is still data, but it does not provide any information. 

**Data security** is the set of policies, procedures, and mechanisms associated with protecting data throughout its entire lifecycle (transmission, processing, and storage). Protecting data means ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

During transmission, we use cryptography to ensure secure communication in the presence of an adversary.

**Cryptography** provides techniques for creating secure communications in the presence of an adversary. A **cipher** is a pair of encryption and decryption algorithms that change the structure of data so that an unauthorized party can no longer read it. The idea of using a cypher is to scamble the data with the use of a key to make our data appear as a random sequence of characters to anyone who does not have access to a copy of that key. 

![[Pasted image 20240828220826.png]]
In the diagram above, $m$ is the plaintext, $c$ is the ciphertext, $E(k, m)$ is the encryption algorithm, $D(k, c)$ is the decryption algorithm, and $k$ is the key. We want $E(k, m)$ and $D(k,c)$ to be consistent and efficient. 

Modern cryptography embraces **Kerchoffs' Principle** (1883), where the security of a cipher must lie in the choice of its keys only; everything else, including the algorithm itself should be considered public knowledge. This assumes the enemy knows the system. 

## Breaking Cyphers
**Cryptanalysis** is the art of recovering the plaintext of a message without access to the key. Even better if the adversary can recover the key as well. A **brute-force** attack checks all possible keys until the correct key is found. While a 56-bit binary key can be brute forced, we consider 128-bit safe and 256-bit perfectly secure. 

## Symmetric Cryptography
The **Caesar cipher** is one of the most basic ciphers, where you shift each letter down the alphabet a set number of spaces. It is easily brute forced as there are only 26 combinations. 

**Substitution** ciphers are a little better, where each letter is scrambled along a predetermined pattern. This can be solved a different way using statistical analysis on letter frequencies. This created the subset of **rotor machines**, which used multiple substitution ciphers for each index of character in the message. 

A **one-time pad**, or Vernam's cipher, uses the XOR operation that achieves perfect secrecy only if the key is at least as long as the message, is truly random, and is not reused. 

**Information theoretic perfect secrecy** states that a cipher $(E,D)$ is provably secure or has perfect secrecy if the cyphertext $c$ reveals no information about the plaintext $m$. The one-time pad is proven to have perfect secrecy when used correctly and we can also prove that any cipher with perfect secrecy requires that the key-length is at least as long as the message. 

### Stream Ciphers
A **stream cipher** is the more general form of the one-time pad. It is an attempt to make the OTP more practical while giving up minimal security. The key idea behind this is to use a pseudorandom key instead of a random key. The pseudorandom generator is a deterministic function that maps a binary seed of length $s$ to a longer binary sequence of length $n > s$, resulting in a seemingly random output sequence. We can denote this key as $k$, giving us the encryption function $c=E(k,m)=m\oplus G(k)$ and decryption function $m=D(k,c)=c \oplus G(k)$. Further, $G(k)$ refers to the sequence generated using $k$ in $G:\{0,1\}^s \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$. 

Because $k$ is shorter than the encrypted message, stream ciphers are not perfectly secure. The security of a stream cipher depends on the **fitness** of the function generator we use. It can be easily broken if it is predictable. Instead of using built-in random functions or most others, you must use a **cryptographically secure pseudorandom generator**. 

The **Rivest Cipher 4** (RC-4) should not be used anymore but is a widely known cipher. 

| Name                                             | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rivest Cipher 4** (RC-4)                       | Widely known cipher but is broken. Many legacy systems still use this. Banned in TLS/SSL                  |
| **eSTREAM** European Union Stream Cipher Project | Contains many ciphers                                                                                     |
| **ChaCha20**                                     | Takes a 256b key, nonce, and a counter to generate bit stream. Encrypt and decrypt with the XOR function. |
|                                                  |                                                                                                           |
The **ChaCha20** algorithm is a black box method that takes a 256-bit key, nonce, and counter and produces a long bit stream. The input is formed into a 4x4 matrix with 32-bit entries (512 bits) and its columns/diagonals are added, rotated, and XORed repeatedly. Then it is returned to a steam of bits and XORed with the plaintext. 

### Block Ciphers
A **block cipher** encrypts and decrypts a fixed number of bits at a time. Encryption and decryption are performed by passing in our source data in fixed $n$ bit chunks to our respective function with key $k$ and appending to our output block. 

| Name     | Description                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| DES/3DES | 64-bit blocks, 56 or 168-bit key          |
| AES      | 128-bit blocks, 128, 192, or 256-bit keys |

AES and DES are **iterated** block ciphers, meaning they use a rotating key system to give each block a different ciphertext. 

#### Digital Encryption Standard (DES)
DES uses a Feistel network of one-way functions $f_1, ..., f_{16}$ to simulate an invertible function. Functions $f(k_i)$ are non-invertible and highly nonlinear. Triple DES (**3DES**) works the same way: by applying DES three times to each data block. It encrypts with the first key, decrypts with the second, and encrypts with the third. 

#### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
Advanced encryption standard, or AES, was selected as the new standard. It was originally named Rijndael, developed by Daemen and Rijmen in Belgium. It's a family of ciphers that can take 128, 192, or 256-bit keys and encrypts 128-bit blocks. AES is based on an SP network, using repeated substitutions and permutations. Between each key layer, it is passed through a substitution and then a permutation layer. 

AES has an electronic codebook (ECB) mode, letting you encrypt a pattern all at once. This is insecure because patterns in the plaintext become evident in the ciphertext. 

There is also cipher block chaining (CBC) mode, where each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous cipher block before being encrypted. This is a sequential process, meaning they cannot be parallelized. CBC mode also suffers from random bit error propagation. 

AES' counter (CTR) mode acts as a stream cipher and uses a counter in combination with a pseudorandom sequence to generate ciphertext. The combination of both is XORed against the plaintext, giving us our ciphertext. Unlike ECB and CBC mode, CTR mode can be parallelized and random bit errors do not propagate. There is also a Galois counter mode, which also provides authenticated encryption. 

AES is a good cipher when used correctly, such as in CTR or CBC mode. Even though we may correctly use AES, though, the key should always be changed because any key reuse will leak some information. AES does not have any known weaknesses, despite having perfect/provable security. It uses a 256-bit key, which can encrypt up to $2^{64}$ data blocks. The NSA claims AES is enough to encrypt up to top-secret data. 

You should only use official implementation libraries of AES in projects or special built-in instruction sets, not your own personal implementation. 

## Asymmetric Cryptography
### Key Exchange
Originally, two people had to share a secret key through a separate secure channel. In 1976, we developed public key protocols like the **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** to address this. 

### Public vs Private Key Cryptography
Public key cryptography is asymmetric and private key cryptography is symmetric. 

In private key cryptography, the same key $k$ is used to encrypt and decrypt data. If an attacker has $k$, they have access to the data. 

In public key cryptography, two separate keys are used during encryption and decryption. They are called private and public keys, related mathematically. The public key may be shared with anyone and allows you to encrypt data to send back to the host (and also provides authentication), and the private key should be kept on the host and allows for decrypting data. 

#### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
Public key algorithms are built on hard-to-solve math problems, such as discrete logarithms for DHKE and factorization of prime numbers for RSA. 

Both RSA and Diffie-Hellman algorithms depend on **modular exponentiation** or prime numbers. Modular exponentiation has both an exponentiation and modulus segment, where we generate our large number and then find the remainder after division $p$. 

**Integers modulo a prime number** are very well behaved, because we can perform all 4 basic operations on them. 

Given a prime $p$:
- **Private key**: Choose a random number $\alpha$ within that group. 
- **Public key**: Compute $A=g^\alpha \mod p$. 
Here, $p$, $g$, $A$, and $B$ are known to everyone. 
When we receive another public key $B$, we compute $B^a\mod p=g^{ba}\mod p$. This is our **shared secret** because we know that $A^b=g^{ab}\mod p$. I didn't think this was a useable formula, so I checked [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa4osob1XOk) and I read that we calculate the shared secret by using $B^a\mod p$ and $A^b\mod p$. 

If we take a prime number $p$, its **multiplicative group modulo $p$** is $\{1,2,3,...,p-1\}$. So if we have $p=7$ , we have the group $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. A prime number is called a **generator** because its resulting group contains every integer smaller than itself, while a composite number will not. Inverting modular exponentiation (modular logarithms) are hard. 

There is also a variation of the DHKE called the **elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman**. Instead of using primes, it uses ellipses and the cubic equation. 

Diffie-Hellman has no information theoretical secrecy. While it is hard to compute, there are algorithms that reduce the complexity of the problem, such as the number field sieve algorithm. Additionally, you can precomputations to speed up the process, such as using a number table. Because of this, 512-bit $p$ is breakable, and 1024-bit $p$ is (if you have dedication and $100m), so it is recommended to use at least a 2048-bit $p$. 

Diffie-Hellman is weak to **man in the middle** attacks. We use **digital signatures** to mitigate this. If your connection is signed, then it has been confirmed by the browser/certificate authority to be the correct public key. 

#### Modular Exponentiation
Computing large numbers is very difficult, especially if we are computing numbers with huge exponents on them. For the purpose of **modular exponentiation**, we can break down the problem by performing one multiplication, then taking mod, then repeating for each exponent. This is good for hand calculations, but is actually found to be insecure because you can measure the time it takes to compute on a processor, leaking information. 

### Public Key Cryptography
**RSA**, published in 1977, is mostly used in digital signatures. It stands for Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, who are the creators of the algorithms. It derives security from the difficulty of factoring large integers that are the product of two large prime numbers. It uses a wide range of mathematical techniques. 

Modular arithmetic modulo prime $p$: Fermat's Little Theorem $x^{p-1}=1\mod p$. 
Modular arithmetic modulo composite $N$ means we can perform add, subtract, multiply with no restriction, however we are limited in divisions. 

RSA requires the greatest common divisor, which we can use the Euclidian algorithm to compute.

Euler's phi function (Euler's Totient Function) $\phi(N)$ produces the number of positive integers less than $N$ that are coprime with $N$. For $N=pq$ where both $p$ and $q$ are prime, $\phi(N)=(p-1)(q-1)=N-p-q+1$. 

Euler's Theorem for RSA: If $x$ and $N$ are coprime, positive integers, then $x^{\phi(N)}=1\mod N$. 

To perform the RSA algorithm, we first find two large primes, $p$ and $q$ and do not share them. Take the product of them, $N=pq$. $N$, also known as the modulus, is difficult to find without knowing $p$ or $q$ and is what we are making public. Also, the length of $N$ in bits is the key length for RSA. Next, calculate the totient $\phi(N)=(p-1)(q-1)$. Next, choose a small integer $e$ that is coprime with $\phi(N)$. Typically, $e$ is chosen as 65537 ($2^{16}+1$) and is made public. $N,e$ become the public key. 

To compute the private key, begin with the totient and $e$, and run $\gcd(e,\phi(N))=1=se-t\phi(N)$, which produces the decryption exponent $d=s\mod\phi(N)$, or $ed=1\mod\phi(N)$. This decryption exponent must be kept secret. 

RSA has no secrecy, it is just hard to compute. 

#### Prime Factorization
The **fundamental theorem of arithmetic** states that every integer greater than one can be written uniquely as a product of prime numbers. 

Not all prime factorization problems are hard. For example, small integers and numbers with many factors are easy to solve. The hardest to factor are **semiprimes**, which are integers that are the product of exactly two primes. 

As of today, we have been able to factor RSA-250, which is a 250 digit semiprime taking 829-bits using 2700 core years. 

#### RSA Weaknesses
**Wiener's Attack** takes advantage of RSA algorithms using a small private key. A small private key is a good idea when you want to speed up RSA decryption, but if it is too small then RSA may be broken. Small public keys are no problem, though. 

RSA is asymmetric partially because it allows for fast encryption and slower decryption. But through side-channel attacks, we can figure out information about the secret key through timing and power consumption (if not implemented correctly). 

We can also factor $N$ by finding its gcd between another $N$. If we take $\gcd(N_1,N_2)=p$, they may share a common prime factor $p$ that then factors two RSA moduli for the cost of one. Additionally, $p$ and $q$ can be improperly generated if the pseudorandom generators are not configured correctly. 

# Data Integrity
**Data integrity** is the property that data has not been altered in an unauthorized or accidental manner, spanning storage, processing, and transit. Not all data needs to meet all 3 in the CIA triad. For example, we don't care about confidentiality when we are downloading a software update, just integrity and authenticity. 

**MAC** provides integrity only for data in transmission and storage. **Authenticated encryption** methods provide both integrity and confidentiality. 

## Integrity Checks and Codes
### Cyclic Redundancy Check
A **cyclic redundancy check** ([[|CRC]]) is an error-detecting code. For each message, a short tag is created and appended to the message. However, CRCs don't use a secret key, so its only purpose is to ensure that the message has been sent without any faults. 

Because nothing is encrypted, it is easy for an attacker to perform a playback attack where they just modify the CRC with an old message $m$. 
### Message Authentication Code
A **message authentication code** is a mechanism to ensure data integrity. It confirms that the content of the message has not been changed, verifies the sender of the message, but does not provide any confidentiality. A MAC is a short tag that is created by the sender, using a secret key, and verified by the receiver using that same key. 

To generate a tag $t$, we use $t=S(k,m)$ and append it to the end of the message. The recipient verifies the tag using $V(k,m,t)=0/1$. Both the signing algorithm $S$ and verification algorithm $V$ must be consistent. 

We can create a secure MAC using a block cipher. It provides confidentiality and is secure for an $n$ bit message. We do this by passing the whole message with key and encrypting it. But this comes with an 100% overhead. 

**Cipher block chaining message authentication code** takes two keys $k_1$ and $k_2$ and XORs each $n$ bits with the key to encrypt it and at the end, encrypts with $k_2$, which becomes the tag. 
### Cryptographic Hash Functions
A **cryptographic hash function** is a deterministic function $H:M\mapsto T$ that maps a message $m$ of arbitrary size to a bit sequence $t$ of fixed length. This output $t$ is called a **tag**, **digest**, or **hash** of the message $m$.

A hash is *not* intended as a cipher that can be decrypted, but it should also not be invertible. It is just there to verify the integrity of the file. 

A hash function $H$ is **secure** if it is:
- **collision resistant**, meaning that it maps many different messages to the same hash but is difficult to find two messages that have the same hash. 
- **difficult to invert**, meaning it is many-to-one and difficult to find a preimage (the original message from hash). 

Cryptographic hash functions have many uses, including usage in: 
- **Password databases**
- **Message authentication**
- **Digital Signatures**
- **Blockchain**
- **Proof of Work**

### Algorithms
- Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) is broken. 160-bit digest.
- Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) 224-512-bit is current standard. 
- Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3) most recent NIST standard, fully different construction

A hash function takes no key, just a message. And we know that a keyless tag does not provide data integrity. 

A **keyed-hash message authentication code** (HMAC) takes a cryptographic hash function and secret key $k$

**RSA digital signatures** are message authentication codes encrypted using private RSA keys and verified using public RSA keys. When we verify this:
- the message $m$ has not been tampered with. (data integrity)
- the message came from expected sender. (sender authentication)
- the sender cannot deny having sent the message. (non-repudiation)

Digital signatures can be used to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks. If we sign with private key, then it acts as our digital signature. 

They also may be used to implement multifactor authentication. Username and passwords alone are not enough. 

# Attacks
Password attacks/cracking are attacks on online portals where the attacker guesses the password or uses an automated tool to solve it for them. Because it is online, it is easily monitored and defended against by using:
- Multifactor authentication
- Choosing good, difficult passwords
- Changing all default passwords
- Increasing timeouts after incorrect guesses
- Locking the account after too many wrong answers
- Using CAPTCHAs (Completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart)

Passwords must have a way to check passwords, meaning the have to store usernames and passwords as pairs in a password database. If this file is stolen, all passwords are compromised. 

If passwords are stored in plaintext, they are vulnerable against offline attacks. The solution to this is to store them as a hash because it is a one-way function. This way, when the user puts in their password, they can just rehash the passed password and if it matches, they are the right person. 

Cryptographic hash functions, again, should not be reverse engineerable. It should be difficult to find a preimage and collision resistant. 

An **offline password attack**, also known as offline cracking, occurs when an attacker steals the file where passwords are saved. They find the hashes or digests instead of the original passwords and then reverse engineers it to get the password. 

A dictionary attack is when the attacker creates a digest of dictionary words (because it is very common for these to be included in passwords). They match these hashes against those in the stolen hash database. They may add different numbers and special characters to increase chances of a match. If they find a match, they have the whole database. 

A **rainbow table** attack uses a large precomputed table of candidate hashes, such as the hashes of all sequences withh 1-8 characters using SHA-256. The attacker does not even need to create the digest, they just match the entries in the rainbow table to the stolen file. The birthday paradox makes the odds of finding a match likely. 

## Offline Attack Defenses
It is best practice to use a long random sequence using the entire character set and use a password manager to save these. Additionally, always only store the hash! 

We can **salt** the hash by adding a random string to the plaintext password before hashing. NIST recommends adding at least 32 bits. It makes attacks more difficult because brute force attacks need a larger search space and it defends against dictionary attacks. Salting also allows users to pick the same password but end up with different digests. 

**Key stretching** is the idea of hashing the password many times, instead of just once. NIST recommends hashing at least 10000 times. This makes it doable for someone logging in, but makes it extremely expensive for an attacker to have to do this for every combination. Rainbow tables will also not work unless they are stretched, as well. 

## Other attacks
**Keyloggers** are another way to steal passwords by recording all of the keystrokes made by a user. 

**Phishing** is where an attacker creates legitimate looking links or websites to trick the user into entering their personal information or passwords. 

We can defend against these with MFA and cybersecurity awareness training. 

# Access Control
**Access control** is the process of granting or denying specific requests to obtain and use information and enter specific physical facilities. 

We can provide this physically by implementing external perimeter defenses, internal physical access control, and prevention of loss and theft. 

## Logical Access Control

Controlling access means granting or denying approval to use a resource. This can be managed via:
- Authorization
- Identification
- Access Approval
- Audit

An access control list is a list of permissions associated with an  object. It specifies who or what is allowed to access the object and what operations are allowed o  be performed on the object, such as a UNIX file permission or network ACL. 

An access control matrix for a system is a database that stores each subject in a row and each object in a column. Each entry is the set of access rights for that subject to that object. 

## Access Control Models
- Mandatory Access Control (Non-discretionary access control)
	- Policy decisions are made by central authority
	- Individual owner of an object cannot change access rights
- Discretionary access control
	- Leaves certain amount of access control to the discretion of the object's owner or anyone else who is authorized to control the object's access
- Role-based access control (vs. identity-based access control)
	- Access and permitted actions are identified with roles rather than identities
- Rule-based access control
	- Access is granted or defined based on a rule set that depends on the combination of attributes of subjects, objects, resources, environment.
- Federated Identities
	- Identity and authentication is conveyed across a set of networked systems, such as OAuth. 
## Information Storage Security
Data security means protecting data in use, in transit, and at rest (storage). Confidentiality of dat aat rest relies heavily on cryptography. There are many threats to the security of data at rest, including:
- Ransomware
- Data breach
- Physical theft
- Unauthorized access
We can defend against these with:
- Access control
- Regular backups/offsite storage
- Encryption

## Disk and File Encryption
The operating system uses access control to protect files on the disk, but is very easy to bypass with access to the disk. Instead, it is a good idea to encrypt the disk or file using a symmetric cipher (such as AES). There are also other AES modes designed for disk encryption, and even other block ciphers for this, such as Two fish or Serpent. 

We can either choose to encrypt the whole disk or individual files. Full disk encryption is transparent to the user once they log on and individual file encryption requires a password to access the file. 

Disk encryption can be performed via the CPU using software, such as BitLocker for Windows and FileVault for macOS. File encryption software, such as PGP, may be used to encrypt files or folders. 
There is also hardware-based disk encryption that is transparent to the OS and performed without CPU involvement. 

After erasure, data is not actually gone, just marked as gone. To fully remove it, you must take extra measures such as degaussing tape, burning paper, wiping disks, etc.
