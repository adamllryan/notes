### Lecture 17: Hardware Security I - Hardware Design Lifestyle
#### **Why Hardware Security?**

**Hardware security** provides the basis for which software security operates. Data resides on hardware, software operates on hardware, and cryptography often requires hardware implementations. Sometimes, cryptography is also implemented in hardware. Secure hardware is foundational for secure data and systems.

#### **Historical Context**
Compared to the entirety of history, the digital age is in its infancy. The transistor was invented in 1947 and integrated circuits were not until 1958-59, which together laid the groundwork for modern computing. **Moore's Law** is the statement that the transistor count in integrated circuits doubles every two years (initially 18 months), and generally remains true. With the continuous growth brought by this, we are dependent on the security of the components of our digital technology.

#### **Meltdown/Spectre Vulnerability (2018)**
The **meltdown** vulnerability is an issue that affects almost every Intel processor. This was published by Google in 2018. The vulnerability exploits a race condition that affects many processors, allowing a process to access the entire system memory without permission.

#### **Defining Hardware Security**
**Hardware security**, as a discipline, is the design of secure and efficient cryptographic algorithms or modules.
- Originated with secure cryptographic module design.
- Encompasses all hardware aspects to ensure correct functionality under attack.
- Key issues: *Side-channel attacks*, supply chain trust, *hardware Trojans*, *intellectual property (IP) protection*, and reverse engineering prevention.

#### **Digital System Design and Security**
- Follows a *System Development Life Cycle*: specification, implementation, optimization, and testing.
- Security concerns should be integrated from the initial specification stage.

#### **System Specification**
- Defined by inputs, outputs, and the functions they perform, down to the binary level.
- Vulnerabilities can arise from incomplete or insufficient specifications, potentially leaving exploitable backdoors.

#### **System Implementation**
- Built using basic logic gates, *flip-flops*, and other hardware elements.
- Boolean functions can be implemented in multiple ways, with optimization reducing resources but potentially introducing security risks.

#### **Function Optimization**
- Aims to minimize hardware requirements, reducing costs and power consumption.
- Techniques include Boolean Algebra and Karnaugh maps.
- Optimization must balance efficiency with comprehensive security to avoid creating vulnerabilities.

#### **Security Cost Considerations**
- Simplified implementations can create security gaps, while complete solutions may increase costs.
- A **backdoor** occurs when your implementation allows inputs to produce unintended outputs. 
- Balancing cost with acceptable risk is a critical aspect of hardware security design.

#### **Physical Attacks on Hardware**
- Require direct access to hardware, specialized tools, and knowledge.
- *Side-channel attacks*: Exploit physical properties (e.g., power consumption, electromagnetic emissions) to gain insights into the hardware’s functioning.

#### **Attacker Classes (IBM Classification)**
1. **Class I**: Outsiders with limited knowledge and resources.
2. **Class II**: Insiders with detailed knowledge and some equipment access.
3. **Class III**: Well-funded organizations with comprehensive resources.

#### **Levels of Tamper Resistance**
1. **Level ZERO**: No special security features.
2. **Level LOW**: Basic security features, easily defeated.
3. **Level MODL**: Moderate cost attacks require more tools and skills.
4. **Level MOD**: Expensive equipment and advanced knowledge needed.
5. **Level MODH**: Highly resistant, very expensive attacks required.
6. **Level HIGH**: Defends against all known attacks; accessible only to governments or large organizations.

#### **FIPS 140 and CMVP**
- *Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3*: Establishes cryptographic module security requirements.
- *NIST CMVP*: Validates cryptographic modules for government use; non-validated modules are considered insecure.

### Explanation
Hardware security is critical for safeguarding data, software, and cryptographic systems. This lecture covers the historical evolution of hardware security, explains its importance, and outlines key vulnerabilities like the Meltdown/Spectre incident. Hardware security is necessary to protect against a range of attackers and tampering methods, with defenses requiring a balance of cost and risk. Standards like FIPS 140 are essential for ensuring secure cryptographic modules. This foundational knowledge sets the stage for further exploration of side-channel attacks, hardware trust issues, and secure hardware lifecycle management.

### Lecture 18: Hardware Security II - Side Channel Attacks

---

#### Recap: Hardware Security

- **System Specification**: Focuses on designing secure hardware systems.
  - Important to balance between security and optimization/performance.
  - **Backdoors**: Undefined inputs in the system specification can create vulnerabilities.
  - **Fault Injection Attack**: Undefined outputs can be exploited to inject faults.
  - Security considerations must be integrated from the beginning of hardware design.

- **Cryptographic Algorithms**: Implementation must be secure and efficient.
  - FIPS 140-3 Security Requirements by NIST: Non-validated cryptography is considered insecure.
  - **Kerckhoff’s Principle**: Emphasizes that a system should remain secure even if the attacker knows everything except the key.

**Explanation**: Hardware security design requires managing trade-offs between performance and security. Proper cryptographic validation ensures that implementations do not leave systems vulnerable to attacks.

#### Side Channel Attacks on RSA

- **Modular Exponentiation**:
  - Fundamental to RSA and Diffie-Hellman.
  - Incorrect implementation can reveal private keys due to side-channel leaks such as timing or power consumption.
  
- **Timing Attacks**:
  - Measures variations in execution time to infer information about the secret key.
  - Success relies on the attacker’s ability to:
    - Measure these variations accurately.
    - Correlate the variations with operations related to the secret key.
  - Mitigation:
    - **Constant Run-Time (CRT)** algorithms.
    - Randomizing execution times to obfuscate timing information.

**Side-channel** attacks: an exploit that attempts to extract secret information from a system by measuring and analyzing physical parameters (such as timing, delay, power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, acoustic signals, etc. ). These attacks combine adversarial thinking and systems thinking. Exploits the implementation of the algorithm, not the actual algorithm. 
**Explanation**: RSA can be vulnerable to side-channel attacks if the implementation of modular exponentiation is not carefully controlled. Timing variations, in particular, can reveal sensitive information unless mitigated through CRT algorithms.

---

#### Power Analysis Attacks

- **Simple Power Analysis (SPA)**:
  - Involves monitoring power consumption during cryptographic operations.
  - By observing differences in power usage (e.g., squaring vs. multiplication), attackers can deduce secret information.
  - Vulnerable when operations depend directly on the value of bits in the key.

- **Differential Power Analysis (DPA)**:
  - More advanced than SPA, using statistical methods to analyze multiple power traces.
  - Can identify correlations and even work in noisy environments to extract information like parts of AES, ECDSA, and HMAC implementations.

**Explanation**: Power analysis attacks leverage the physical side effects of computation to reveal cryptographic keys. SPA looks at single traces, while DPA uses statistical methods across multiple traces, making it more powerful and harder to mitigate without advanced countermeasures.

---

#### Side-Channel Attack Mitigation

- **Mitigation Approaches**:
  - **Shielding**: Physically protect hardware components to reduce leakage.
  - **Runtime Control**: Techniques like CRT algorithms and randomized execution times help eliminate correlations between leaked information and sensitive data.

- **TEMPEST Regulations**:
  - Developed by the NSA to protect against electromagnetic (EM) emissions.
  - Includes guidelines for:
    - Spatial separation.
    - Shielding and adding noise to mask sensitive signals.

**Explanation**: To combat side-channel attacks, mitigation involves both hardware shielding and software-level techniques like constant and randomized execution times. TEMPEST regulations emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to prevent EM signal leakage.

---

#### Power LED Side-Channel Attack

- Attackers can analyze LED light output as an indirect measure of CPU power consumption.
- **Method**: Capturing high frame-rate video footage of an LED to track changes correlates with CPU activity, potentially revealing secret operations.
- Example: *Minerva Attack* on ECDSA, demonstrating the use of adversarial thinking to exploit hardware weaknesses.

**Explanation**: Power LED attacks show how even indirect observations, such as monitoring LED behavior, can leak sensitive information. This highlights the importance of adversarial and systems thinking in securing hardware implementations.

### Explanation

Side-channel attacks exploit physical leaks (e.g., timing, power consumption, EM emissions) in cryptographic implementations, targeting hardware design vulnerabilities. The lecture covers various attack methods like SPA, DPA, and timing attacks, emphasizing the importance of implementing mitigations such as CRT algorithms, shielding, and TEMPEST regulations. Understanding these attacks and defenses is crucial for designing secure cryptographic systems, illustrating the balance needed between hardware efficiency and security.

### Lecture 19: Hardware Security III - Meltdown/Spectre/Supply Chains and Trust

---

#### Spectre/Meltdown Attacks
- **Speculative/Transient Execution Vulnerabilities**:
  - *Spectre*:
    - **Variant 1**: Bounds check bypass (CVE-2017-5753).
    - **Variant 2**: Branch target injection (CVE-2017-5715).
  - *Meltdown*:
    - **Variant 3**: Rogue data cache load (CVE-2017-5754).
    - Specifically affects Intel processors, potentially all since 1995.
- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**:
  - Database of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
  - *NIST* recommends using CVE IDs for identifying vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Patches and software updates implemented, often affecting performance, especially in cloud computing.

**Explanation**: Spectre and Meltdown are critical attacks exploiting speculative execution in CPUs. Spectre affects various architectures (Intel, AMD, ARM), while Meltdown is limited to Intel processors. Mitigation involves software updates, though they may degrade performance.

---

#### Speculative Execution
- **In-order Execution**:
  - Instructions are executed sequentially; if data is missing, the CPU stalls.
- **Out-of-order Execution**:
  - Instructions are executed in parallel to optimize performance, allowing the CPU to work on later tasks while waiting for stalled instructions.
- **Branch Prediction and Speculative Execution**:
  - CPUs guess the outcome of branches and execute speculatively.
  - If incorrect, results are discarded; however, the process can still leak information.

**Explanation**: Speculative execution optimizes CPU performance but introduces vulnerabilities when incorrect guesses expose sensitive information, even if results are discarded.

---

#### Speculative Execution Vulnerabilities
- **Transient Execution**:
  - Incorrect speculative execution temporarily changes the CPU state.
- **Side-Channel Attacks**:
  - Adversaries exploit information such as cache timing to leak sensitive data.
  - *Covert Channels*: Techniques like cache manipulation are used in Spectre/Meltdown.

**Explanation**: Even though CPUs restore their states after speculative execution errors, attackers can access information left in microstates, such as cache data, using side-channel methods.

---

#### Defending Against Spectre/Meltdown
- **Patches**:
  - Operating systems and CPU microcode updates aim to mitigate risks.
  - Negative impact on performance, especially in cloud environments.
- **Considerations**:
  - Evaluating CPU options and adhering to recommendations from *SEI CERT*.

**Explanation**: Patching and microcode updates are primary defense mechanisms, although they may lead to performance trade-offs. Cloud systems face particular risks due to shared CPU resources.

---

#### Component Security and Supply Chains
- **Component Security**:
  - Ensures a chain of trust from design to delivery.
  - Involves protecting integrated circuits (ICs) from risks such as hardware Trojans, cloning, and IP theft.
- **Supply Chain Risks**:
  - Malicious modifications, counterfeit components, and reliance on untrusted suppliers.
- **NIST SP 800-53**:
  - Emphasizes the need for resilient and trustworthy components across critical infrastructure.

**Explanation**: Component security focuses on securing hardware supply chains and maintaining trust through rigorous testing and supplier vetting, aligned with NIST guidelines for critical infrastructure.

---

#### Hardware Trojans
- **Definition**:
  - Malicious modifications to ICs aimed at controlling, leaking information, or reducing reliability.
- **Examples**:
  - Functional Trojans: Change IC behavior by adding or deleting gates/transistors.
  - Parametric Trojans: Reduce reliability through subtle changes such as thinned wires, weakened transistors, ionizing radiation.
  - Big/small trojans: Addition of logic blocks
  - Loose/Tight trojans: distributed or focused in an area.
  - Always-on Trojan: always on
  - Condition-triggered: activated by some condition.
  - 
- **Detection**:
  - Testing, reverse engineering, and side-channel analysis are common methods.
  - Balancing false positives and false negatives is crucial.
  - It is difficult to differentiate between hardware trojan and noise.
  - Destructive detection tries to reverse engineer via disassembly and destruction of component. 

**Explanation**: Hardware Trojans can compromise ICs in various ways, and detecting them involves a combination of invasive and non-invasive techniques, each with challenges in distinguishing malicious activity from natural variations.
