# Process
Operating systems can execute different types of programs. **Batch-system** programs are named jobs, and **time-shared** systems are user programs or tasks. 

A **process** (job) is a program in execution that must progress sequentially. Each process includes a **program counter**, **stack**, and **data section**. Diagram-wise, a process in memory may look like this:

# Process State
A process has a **state** that changes as its execution progresses. 

| State          | Description                                          |     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **New**        | The process is being created                         |     |
| **Running**    | Instructions are being executed                      |     |
| **Waiting**    | The process is waiting for an event to occur         |     |
| **Ready**      | The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor |     |
| **Terminated** | The process has finished execution                   |     |
These states progress in a certain order, and can be represented by the below graph:

# Process Control Block (PCB)
The **process control block** is a block of data containing important information about each process:
- Process state  
- Program counter  
- CPU registers  
- CPU scheduling information  
- Memory-management information  
- Accounting information  
- I/O status information

# OS Scheduling Basics
We can increase CPU utilization through the use of **multiprogramming**.
