#segmentation is a memory-management scheme that supports user view of memory. A segment is a logical unit such as:
- main program
- procedure
- function
- method
- object
- variable
- block
- stack
- symbol table
- array

#segment-table maps two-dimensional physical address. It contains a #base (starting physical address) and a #limit (length of the segment). 
#segment-table-base-register points to the segment talbe's location in memory and #segment-table-length-register indicates number of segments used by a program.
