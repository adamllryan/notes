# Introduction
The link layer is between two machines. It's the Uber, plane, and train system between locations. They have different services but do the same things. 
# Error Detection, Correction
We include a datagram EDC footer on each to use parity checking. Internal links can use single bit parity because it's much lower chance of having more than a single bit flipping, and we use two-dimensional bit parity so that we can detect and correct a flipped bit. 

## Cyclic Redundancy Check/Code
# Multiple Access Protocols
TDMA - code division multiple access.  like the talking stick. it splits bandwidth into chunks and users take turns. 
FDMA - frequency division. like CDMA but we are dividing bandwidth and sharing. 
CDMA - 

CSMA - Carrier sense multiple access. Listen before transmit. If a channel is sensed idle, transmit entire frame.
