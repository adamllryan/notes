4 things to connect to the internet
ip address
default router
local dns
subnet mask

4 things a protocol defines
rules of what to do with the messages
semantics of the messages
types of messages exchanged
syntax of the messages

a router does not use all 5 layers of osi

packet length no impact on propagation delay

tcp allows return path to be different on the way back

internet nuts and bolts is made of hosts,end stations,connections,packet switches

default router routes things to machines not on your local network

tdm and fdm have different connection support size

saturating a link results in long delays

smtp uses tcp

project 1 requires two sockets
