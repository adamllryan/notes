Hidden terminal problem

# CDMA
Every user is assigned an 8-bit chipping code.

# Network Security

*Confidentiality*: Only the sender and receiver should be able to understand a message. (Encryption)
*Authentication*: Sender and receiver want to confirm the identity of each other. 
*Message Integrity*: Sender and receiver want to ensure message has not been altered at any point. 
*Access and availability*: Services must be accessible and available to users -- has to be practical, not using the cone-of-silence. 

# Security Risks
*Eavesdrop*: Interception of messages or insert messages into connection. 
*Impersonation*: Spoofing a source address in a packet. 
*Hijacking*: Take over an ongoing connection by removing sender or receiver, injecting self into their place. 
*Denial of Service*: Prevent service from being used by others. (such as overloading resources)

# Breaking Encryption
With cipher text only:
*Brute Force*: Search through all possible keys
*Statistical Analysis*: Analyze something like most common letter
