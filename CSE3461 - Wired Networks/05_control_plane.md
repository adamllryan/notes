# Traditional Routing Algorithms
## Routing Algorithm Classification
*Global*: All routers have complete topology. Everything has complete knowledge of everything, very expensive. 
These use "link state" algorithms, usually for internal networks. 
*Decentralized*: Get costs to neighbors and information from neighbors. Takes longer. Usually implemented with "Distance Vector" algorithms. 
BGP Holds the internet together. 
*Static*: Routes change slowly over time. 
*Dynamic*: Routes change more quickly, with periodic updates or in response to link cost changes.
