# Salary Negotiation

## How employers determine salary

- Market conditions
- Supply and demand
- Your experience/value of previous experience
- Degree level and level of job in organization
- Cost of living
- Industry standards
- Company-specific factors

Do not disclose your current salary. Instead, ask for the salary range for the position. If they insist on knowing your current salary, give them a range.
Avoid pre-offer Negotiation.
Don't reveal bottom-line number
Don't accept the first offer
Don't be the first to mention a number
Don't negotiate until you have an offer in writing
Don't negotiate until you have a clear understanding of the job and the company's expectations

First interview you are focusing on what you and the company can offer. Don't focus on money and salary.

Salary statistics are available on the internet. and at osu.

Most of the time negotiating with HR.

Benefits are really not negotiable. You can maybe ask for them to pay for certifications.
