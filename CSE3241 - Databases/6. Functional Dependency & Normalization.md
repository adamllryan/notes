# Informal Design Guidelines

## Guideline 1

Design relation schema so that it is easy to explain its meaning. Don't combine attributes from different entity/relation types into a single relation. 
## Guideline 2

Design relation schemas such that there is no redundant informations stored in a tuple and such that no update anomalies will occur. Group attributes into relation schemas. 
### Data Anomalies
*Insertion Anomaly*: In a combined database where two entities share a relation, we cannot edit one attribute until the other has at least one tuple. 
*Update Anomaly*: If we change one attribute, we must change that attribute for all tuples. 
*Deletion Anomaly*: If we delete all the entities related to another entities, all of its data is also gone. 
## Guideline 3
We should design relations such that their tuples have as few *null* values as possible. Attributes that are null may be placed in separate relations. 
Valid reasons to have null values:
Attribute is not applicable or invalid
Attribute value is unknown
Value known to exist but is unavailable
## Guideline 4
Relations should be designed to satisfy the lossless join conditions. No spurious tuples should be made with a natural join of any relations. 
Avoid generation of spurious tuples at any cost.
