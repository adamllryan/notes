Database Management Systems are software used to manage and access data. 
[[Database Management System]] manages a [[Database]] and is accessed by your python (or something) program, which is considered the [[Application Programs and Queries]]. 

### Database System
A database system contains a complete definition of structure and constraints. 
It contains [[Metadata]] and a [[Database Catalog]]. 

### Other Terms
[[Database Schema]]
[[Schema Diagram]]
[[Schema Construct]]
[[Database state or Snapshot]]

### The purpose of DMBS
The purpose is to provide insulation between programs and data. Middleman software that has the same method of access between any program as long as the data needs to be the same. **DATA ABSTRACTION, PROGRAM-DATA INDEPENDENCE, MUTABLE**

### Architecture
The standard architecture is a three-tier client-server system architecture. Built out of Client (Web interface and GUI), Application Server (Application Programs and Backend processing and Web pages), and Database Server (DBMS, SQLite, SQL, Microsoft, etc.). 

Abstraction allows for support of multiple views of the data. Allows access restriction and is a subset of the database. 

### Three Schema Architecture
Made out of multi-user [[External View]], derived [[Conceptual Schema]], and base [[Internal Schema]].
