# A simple database model
A *database* is simply a collection of named data items. *Data granularity* refers to a field, a record, a table, or a whole disk block. The set of valid operations are *retrieve*, *change*, *read*, and *write*. 

# Transactions
A *transaction* is a logical unit of database processing. It is a set of [[Operations|operations]] that includes at least one *access* operation (read/write/delete). 

For example, the process of moving money from a savings account to a checking account would require the following transaction: 

``` Sample transaction
Read balance from checking
Read balance from savings
savings balance -= value
checking balance += value
Write balance to checking
Write balance to savings
```

Databases can receive transactions in any order, at the same time. This means a DBMS must be able to handle requests *concurrently*.
