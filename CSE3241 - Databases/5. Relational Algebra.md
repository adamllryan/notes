## Relational Algebra & Calculus
We use [[Relational Algebra]] and [[Relational Calculus]] to express the types of requests we want to perform on databases. 

A [[Relational Algebra]] expression is a *sequence of relational algebra operations*. 

## Relational Algebra

Unary operations:
- SELECT
- PROJECT
- RENAME
Relational Algebra Operations
- UNION
- INTERSECTION
- DIFFERENCE
- CARTESIAN PRODUCT

## Operations

[[Operations]] produce new relations. The result of an operation is a *new relation*, possibly formed from one or more *input* relations. The algebra is "closed", where all object in relational algebra are relations. 

[[Expressions]] are the result of a relational algebra expression, represents a database query or retrieval request. 

## Unary relational Operations

SELECT Operation - Ïƒ(sigma)
$$\sigma_{<\text{selection condition}>(R)}$$
where \<selection condition> is applied independently to each individual tuple t in R

**Example:**
$\sigma_{\text{SALARY>30k}}(EMPLOYEE)$

PROJECT Operation - $\pi$(pi)
$$\pi_{\text{<attribute list>}}(R)$$
SELECTS all attributes from attribute list in R. Discards other things. 

**Example:**
$\pi_{\text{LNAME, FNAME, SALARY}}(\text{EMPLOYEE})$
