## Edges

An **edge** is a rapid change in color or brightness. For example, a sudden change from the black of a chalkboard to the white of the wall behind it is considered an edge. This is important because often, edges display object boundaries, reflectance changes/patterns, and sharp changes in surface orientation.

Let's start with a 1D signal to demonstrate. Here are some idealized 1D edges. Think of this as one row in an image, where the height of the line represents the brightness of that row.

A **difference** or **derivative mask** is a filter that takes the approximate derivative of the image and uses that as our filtered image. When nearby pixels are of similar brightness, the difference is zero, and our derivative value is zero. When we have a large change, the difference is large, and the derivate image has a high value at that location.

We typically use Gaussian (or other) smoothing beforehand to remove noise, which takes the form of small and simple differences. This can be simplified by taking the derivative of the smoothing kernel instead of smoothing and then differentiating. This also results in smaller noise responses from derivative estimates.

The second derivative is zero when the magnitude of the derivative is at its peak. This is a good method to find where the large changes are. However, it produces double-sided edges, so we need to fix this. We can solve this by using a Gaussian second-derivative mask.

Now, let's consider 2 dimensions. Instead of needing to consider 2 directions, now we have infinite directions. The solution to do this is to use gradients. A gradient is a matrix that is filled with the direction of most movement at that point.

Some classic approaches (Prewitt and Sobel) separate operations into horizontal and vertical components
