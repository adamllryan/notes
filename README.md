This is all of my general notes. Uses the [[Zettelkasten]] concept (built into Obsidian) and modified [[PARA Note Organization Structure|PARA]] as a note organization structure. 

## Directory

PARA adds a projects, areas, resources, and archive folder. My notes change this and instead use **projects**, **areas**, and **resources**. Each directory stores its own named archive folder. 

More specifically:

**Projects** are used for all of my current projects and move through the **planning**, **in-process**, and **completed** stages (folders for now).

**Areas** are used for broad range aspects of life. Most likely finance and general organization. 

**Resources** are for learning topics, likely computer science subjects and fields. Instead of using an archive folder, it uses a folder named **completed** to store notes from a course that are concluded/fully-taken. For general definitions not tied to a specific subject, there are general dictionary folders, categorized as **\_algorithms**, **\_data structures**, and **\_definitions**. 

## Linking
Notes, in order to keep a well-defined tagging system, should all have:
- **created-during**: a line for where the note was created (e.g. "OSU" or "Fidelity").
- **course** (optional): a line for what course or subject the note falls under.
- **tags** (optional): a list of miscellaneous tags.
- **topics**: a list of topics that the document mentions or may relate to. 
- **completed**: a boolean stating if the document is in a good/final state.
