Parsing is one of the most important parts of language & speech. In the English language, we have a set of grammars, which are the types of words and structures that make a sentence correct. We have the following types of words: adjectives, conjunctions, determiners, verbs, nouns, pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, and interjections. To make an English sentence correct, we can create a grammar to define correct structures of sentences:

- sentence ::= noun-phrase verb phrase.
- noun-phrase ::= determiner noun | noun-phrase preposition-phrase
- verb-phrase ::= verb noun-phrase | verb-phrase preposition-phrase
- preposition-phrase ::=preposition noun-phrase  
This structure will at least allow us to create most sentences in English. It may not sound correct, but it is syntactically correct.

## Applications

Parsing in the modern day is used in machine translation in order to translate between languages. Other applications are speech synthesis from parses, speech recognition using parsing, compositional semantics, and information extraction.

## CKY Algorithm

CKY Algorithm is a parsing algorithm used to determine if a sentence is part of a language. We take every word and fill the bottom row of an NxN table where N is the length of the sentence with the simplest terminal the respective word is represented by. The following rows going up have a height of one less per row, forming a left-oriented staircase. From left to right, bottom to top, we combine the previous row's largest possible group of terminals into its parent nonterminal, and fill the leftmost grid slot with the nonterminal. Repeat until at the top, and if the top left grid slot is empty, the sentence is not part of the grammar. See [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm) for more information.

A massive set of Wall Street Journal content that has been analyzed for syntax and parsed into trees. Each sentence is a file and each file contains a tree where a unique sentence has been analyzed.
