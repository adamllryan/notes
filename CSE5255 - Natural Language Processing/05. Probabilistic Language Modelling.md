# Probabilistic Language Model

A probabilistic language model is a statistical model that is used to predict the probability of a word given the previous words in the sequence. It is used to predict the next word in a sequence of words. It is also used to evaluate the probability of a sentence. It is used in various natural language processing tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation.

It takes a sequence of words and uses the conditional probability of each word given the previous words to predict the probability of the next word. It uses the chain rule of probability to calculate the probability of a sequence of words. It is defined by the formula:

$$
P(w_1, w_2, w_3, ..., w_n) = P(w_1)P(w_2|w_1)P(w_3|w_1, w_2)...P(w_n|w_1, w_2, ..., w_{n-1})
$$

Where $w_1, w_2, w_3, ..., w_n$ are the words in the sequence.

## Markov Assumption

A probabilistic language model is based on the Markov assumption. The Markov assumption states that the probability of a word depends only on the previous $n$ words. It is defined by the formula:

$$
P(w_n|w_1, w_2, ..., w_{n-1}) = P(w_n|w_{n-1}, w_{n-2}, ..., w_{n-n+1})
$$

Where $w_1, w_2, w_3, ..., w_n$ are the words in the sequence.

The Markov assumption approximates each component in the product in above.
