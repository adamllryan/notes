Sample questions  
Linguistic data and data structures  
Ambiguity: Give an example of an ambiguous sentence.  
Parts of speech: Give an example of an English word that is ambiguous between verb and  
noun.

Context Free Grammars: Given the following CF rules, draw 2 possible tree structures for a  
(specified) example sentence  
Hidden Markov Models:  
- what the three probability distributions of an HMM?  
- Here is the forward (or backward) algorithm presented in pseudocode with a key step  
left for you to fill in. Do so!  
NLP datasets and tasks  
Textual entailment: what is textual entailment?  
Named entity recognition:  
- give examples of three types of named entity that could be found by an NER tagger.  
- Explain how the BIO scheme encodes the boundares of the entities.  
Factoid question answering and open-domain question answering.  
- What is a factoid question?  
- What does it mean to say that a QA system is open-domain?  
Machine Learning  
Training, validation and test sets  
- Explain why it is important to use separate training and test sets in machine learning for  
NLP. What goes wrong if you don’t?  
- What is a validation (sometimes also called “development”) set for? How would you use  
it in a project.  
Linear separability  
- If you have a dataset and you want to train a binary classifier to distinguish between the  
two classes, what does it mean for the dataset to be linearly separable?  
- Draw a diagram showing two two-dimensional datasets, one linearly separable, one  
not?  
Cross-validation  
- What is cross-validation? When would you use it in a machine learning project?  
Metrics (Precision, Recall, F1)  
- What is a false positive? What is a false-negative?  
- Given counts of false positives, false negatives, true positives, true negatives, calculate  
precision, recall and F1.  
Learning curves

- What are learning curves for? How do you make them? What do they tell you?  
Human evaluation  
- Imagine that you want to get human judgments on the accuracy of a classifier which you  
have made that aims to find the boundaries of English sentences  
o What might go wrong if you rely on your own judgment?  
o What might go wrong if you use one highly expert judge, then later need to  
repeat the process.  
- What’s a good way of correcting for chance agreement between judges?  
Project planning  
Hypothesis  
Claims  
Evidence plan  
I’ll give you a scenario for a project that someone might do for this class, and ask you to come  
up with an initial hypothesis, two claims that you might wish to support, and an evidence plan  
for finding out about each of the claims.
