NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence, mediated by language. Classical AI aims to study intelligence using computational methods, and can drift into philosophy. It is hard to define intelligence. 

Applied AI is about generalizable methods for achieving useful automation that approaches or exceeds human capabilities. 

We treat words of as vectors or TOKENS (on average 0.7 of a word each). Think of tools such as Word2Vec, GLOVE, LSI. It's a mix of semi-supervised training of very powerful models. 

Since August of last year, we have seen the following changes:
- We have serious open-source transformer models
- Efficiency gains for inference and training
- Reached peak hype cycle of GenAI
- Approached Copyright concerns, legislations, and now have insights. 

This course will cover the following:
- Scientific thinking
- evaluation
- enjoyment of language
- probability and calculus
- basic linear algebra
- Python data skills
- LLM tools like PyTorch and LLM APIs
- Communication, Agile, reading and writing efficiently
