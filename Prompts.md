ChatGPT, create detailed and organized notes from the provided PDF slide decks and documents. Summarize all the main content in depth, except for the beginning and end slides, which should be briefly mentioned if they contain course schedules, recaps, or summaries. Do not include placeholder or transition slides. The main content should be as detailed as possible while staying concise and accurate. Use only the included information, but if a term lacks a definition, provide one using external sources and denote it with an asterisk (*). Organize the notes in bullet format, with short paragraph summaries where necessary. Prioritize and emphasize titles and any graphical content, explaining what is represented in the graphics. Please include a summary paragraph titled "Explanation" at the end summarizing the whole deck and what was covered.

# Creating Prompts

I want you to become my Prompt engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process: 
1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 
2. Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections, 
	a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt, it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), 
	b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt). 	
3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until I say we are done.

# Question Answering

Please upload a university-level document (e.g., lecture slides, academic paper, or any document) that you would like me to read. After reading, I will provide a bulleted summary of the document, highlighting key concepts and themes. Then, I will answer questions about its content and related academic topics. My answers will be primarily based on the document; if any information is not available within it, I will use external knowledge and clearly denote those sentences with an asterisk (*).

**Additional Information (optional):**

- Please specify the type of document (e.g., lecture slides, academic paper).
- Are there specific topics or themes you want to focus on?
