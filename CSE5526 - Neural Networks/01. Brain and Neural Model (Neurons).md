## Brain

The *human cerebral cortex* has regions taht are sensitive to different stimuli. These regions are known as topographic maps. This part of the brain is divided into four lobes:

- occipital
- temporal
- parietal
- frontal

The brain is filled with neurons, which generate electric pulses and respond to stimuli. These responses can occur within milliseconds, and can continue for several hundreds of milliseconds. Neighboring neurons often show common responses. Our brain is made of roughly 10^11 neurons, each connected to (on average) 10^4 neurons. Because of this, our brain is an interconnected neural network.

## Neurons

A neuron has a tree-like structure. The main components of these are:

- Dendrites, which receive signals
- Cell body, generates signal
- Axon, Channel for impulses
- Synapse, terminates impulse

*Excitatory*, or positive responses are where a neuron on the receiving side increases activity, and *inhibitory* is the reverse where activity is decreased. A neuron will only fire when it receives enough excitatory connections.

In short, a **neuron** is a unit or node, a **synapse** is a connection or architecture, and the **synaptic weight** is the connection strength, either positive or negative.
