# Convolutional Neural Networks

A convolutional neural network is a network inspired by biology.

# Convolution Operation

The convolutino operation, denoted with an asterisk, is an operation that takes two functions f and g and produces a third function that represents how the shape of one is modified by the other. It gives us a function that tells us how function 1 "convolves" into function 2.

The convolution operation is defined as:

$$s(t) = (x * w)(t) = \sum_{a = -\infty}^{\infty} x(a)w(t - a)$$

Where:

- x is the input
- w is the kernel
- s is the output
