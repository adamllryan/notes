A biologically-inspired approach for learning to complete a task that may be easy or natural for humans. This is accomplisher with a set of connected artificial neurons, a learning algorithm, and data.

Neural Networks are useful because they can:

- approximate any functional relationship (with [[11_perceptrons#Network Structures|sufficient]] hidden layers) between input and output layers.
- learn from examples.
- generalize well to new but similar data.
- efficient to evaluate.
- suited to massive parallelization.
