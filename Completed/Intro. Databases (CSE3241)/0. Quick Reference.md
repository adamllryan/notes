# Types of Keys
1. **Candidate Key**: A set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple within a table. It must contain unique values and can contain NULL values. Every table must have at least a single candidate key. A table can have multiple candidate keys but only one primary key.
2. **Primary Key**: A unique key that can identify only one tuple (a record) at a time. It has no duplicate values, it has unique values. It cannot be NULL. Primary keys are not necessarily to be a single column; more than one column can also be a primary key for a table.
3. **Super Key**: A set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple. A super key is a group of single or multiple keys that identifies rows in a table. It supports NULL values. Adding zero or more attributes to the candidate key generates the super key.
4. **Alternate Key**: All the keys which are not primary keys are called alternate keys. It is a secondary key. It contains two or more fields to identify two or more records. These values are repeated.
5. **Foreign Key**: A column or group of columns used in a relational database to link data between tables. A foreign key serves to reference the primary key of another existing table, thereby establishing a link between them.
6. **Composite Key**: A combination of two or more columns in a table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in the table. Uniqueness is only guaranteed when the columns are combined; when taken individually the columns do not guarantee uniqueness.
# Relational Schema Rules
1. **Uniqueness**: Every table must contain a unique key. This ensures that each record in the table can be uniquely identified.
2. **Minimize Redundancies**: The schema should be designed in a way to avoid unnecessary duplication of data.
3. **Minimize Nulls**: Try to design the schema in such a way that the occurrence of null values is minimized.
4. **Primary Key**: The field that is the primary key of the table is usually quoted on top of the other fields.
5. **Logical and Physical Schemas**: There are two different types of schemas: logical and physical. A logical schema represents how data is organized within the table, and a physical schema represents how data is physically stored on disk storage.
# Normalization and Functional Dependencies
[**Normalization**](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/database-normalization)[1](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/database-normalization)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)[3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/access/database-normalization-description)[4](https://database.guide/what-is-normalization/): Normalization is a method in relational database design which helps properly organize data tables. The process aims to create a system that faithfully represents information and relationships without data loss or redundancy. It is achieved through a set of rules known as normal forms. The stages of normalization are:

- Unnormalized Form (UNF): The state before any normalization. Redundant and complex values are present.
- First Normal Form (1NF): Repeating and complex values split up, making all instances atomic.
- Second Normal Form (2NF): Partial dependencies decompose to new tables. All rows functionally depend on the primary key.
- Third Normal Form (3NF): Transitive dependencies decompose to new tables. Non-key attributes depend on the primary key.
- Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): Transitive and partial functional dependencies for all candidate keys decompose to new tables.
- Fourth Normal Form (4NF): Removal of multivalued dependencies.
- Fifth Normal Form (5NF): A database is normalized when it fulfills the 5NF.

[**Functional Dependencies**](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/database-normalization)[5](https://www.guru99.com/dbms-functional-dependency.html)[6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-functional-dependencies-in-dbms/)[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_dependency)[8](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/functional-dependency)[9](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/functional-dependencies-2/): Functional Dependency (FD) is a constraint that determines the relation of one attribute to another attribute in a Database Management System (DBMS). It plays a vital role in maintaining the quality of data in the database and finding the difference between good and bad database design. A functional dependency is denoted by an arrow “→”. The functional dependency of X on Y is represented by X → Y. There are mainly four types of Functional Dependency:

- Multivalued Dependency
- Trivial Functional Dependency
- Non-Trivial Functional Dependency
- Transitive Dependency

**Unnormalized Form (UNF)**: This is the starting point where your data is just a big mess. You have complex and redundant values all over the place.

**First Normal Form (1NF)**: You clean up the mess a bit by breaking down complex and repeating values. Now, each cell in your table has only one value.

**Second Normal Form (2NF)**: You take a closer look at your tables and realize that some columns depend only on part of the primary key (if it’s a composite key). So, you split those out into separate tables.

**Third Normal Form (3NF)**: You notice that some columns don’t depend on the primary key at all, but on other columns. Again, you split those out into separate tables.

**Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: This is a stricter version of 3NF. Here, every determinant must be a candidate key.

**Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**: You deal with the few remaining anomalies caused by multi-valued dependencies (when one attribute determines multiple sets of other attributes).

**Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**: Also known as Project-Join Normal form, it deals with cases where information can be reconstructed from smaller pieces of data that can be maintained with less redundancy.
