## Types of languages
There are two main types of programming languages: imperative and declarative. **Imperative languages** (like C, Fortran, and Rust) are languages that do exactly what the programmer tells it to do. **Declarative languages**, on the other hand, handle the logic for the programmer. Essentially, the difference between imperative and declarative languages is what and how you get what you want.

Languages can be divided into four paradigms: non-object-oriented imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logic languages. Non-OO imperative languages are languages like C, Rust, and Quandry. Object-oriented languages include C++, Java, and C#. Functional languages include Lisp, Scheme, and ML. Logic languages include Datalog and Prolog.

## Executing a program
Programs can be executed through **compilation** or **interpretation**. 

**Compiler**: reads your source code and converts it into an executable file for your OS to run. 
**Interpretation**: reads your source code and runs it on the fly, but is normally slower because it needs to perform optimizations as it goes.
