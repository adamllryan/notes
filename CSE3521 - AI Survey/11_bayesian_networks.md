# Dependent Feature Variables
Most real-world data has high-dimensional/correlated variables. (Think pixels, words, genes)
We need a probabilistic model. 

# Chain rule of probability 

# Conditional Independence

# Markov Models

# Probabilistic Graphical Models

# Graph terminology

Clique is any sub complete graph
Child, parent, ancestor, decedents, neighbors, cycle, tree

# directed graphical models
Graphical model whose graph is a DAG. Also known as Bayes network/belief network.
