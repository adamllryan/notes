# Parameter estimation
Probability models often have parameters. Bernoulli distribution (two outcomes), categorical distribution (multiple discrete assignments, Bernoulli with 3+ assignments), Gaussian distribution (continuous). 

Bernoulli: 0<=gamma<=1 True=gamma False=1-gamma
## Likelihood function
is the goodness fit of a model
## Maximum likelihood estimation
P(observations;parameters). Choose the params that maximize probability of observed data. 
Log-likelihood, differentiate, equate to zero and solve
d/dxlogx=0
## Gaussian distribution

P(X=x)=

MLE alternatives: bayesian parametrics. Uses parameters as vars themselves
