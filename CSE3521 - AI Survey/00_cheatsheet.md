# Intro Content
AI has 4 goals:

- think like people
- think rationally
- act like people
- act rationally

[Turing Test]: Outdated/rudimentary test to determine if AI is successful. Human judge converses with entity (person or AI) for 5 minutes and guesses if it is AI.

`Rational` means to behave in a very specific way:

- maximize achieving pre-defined goals
- only consider decisions, not the thought process behind them
- goals expressed in terms of utility of outcomes
- maximizing your expected utility

[Types of AI]:

- Speech Processing & natural language processing
  - automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, dialog systems
- Computer Vision
  - Object and facial recognition, scene segmentation, and image classification

# Categories of ML
## Static or Dynamic
*Static*: The world does not change while the agent is thinking. Decision time does not matter!
*Dynamic*: The world is changing while the agent is thinking. Decision time matters!
## Discrete or Continuous
*Discrete*: Possible states are distinct and/or the world changes discretely. Think integers. 
*Continuous*: Possible states take continuous values. Think floats. 

## Deterministic or Stochastic
*Deterministic*: The next state is fully determined by current state and agent action. If sent back to the same state, you can repeat this 100% of the time. 
*Stochastic*: The next state has some element of randomness. There is some uncertainty.
