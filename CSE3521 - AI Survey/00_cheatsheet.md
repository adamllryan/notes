AI has 4 goals:

- think like people
- think rationally
- act like people
- act rationally

[Turing Test]: Outdated/rudimentary test to determine if AI is successful. Human judge converses with entity (person or AI) for 5 minutes and guesses if it is AI.

`Rational` means to behave in a very specific way:

- maximize achieving pre-defined goals
- only consider decisions, not the thought process behind them
- goals expressed in terms of utility of outcomes
- maximizing your expected utility

[Types of AI]:

- Speech Processing & natural language processing
  - automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, dialog systems
- Computer Vision
  - Object and facial recognition, scene segmentation, and image classification
