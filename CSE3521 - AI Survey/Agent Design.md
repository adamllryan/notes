It's hard to define AI. We want it to: think like people, act rationally, think rationally, and act like people. 

Turing test is not the best test but its an early benchmark of AI progress. 

Much of AI is concerned with [[agents]] operating in [[environments]]. 

Percept: Agent's perceptual inputs at any given instant
Percept Sequence: Complete history of everything agent has percieved
Action choice: What the agent does in response to percept or percept sequence

PEAS
Performance - monitor performance
Environment - what is the environment like?
Actuators - what can it do
Sensors - what are the sensors?
