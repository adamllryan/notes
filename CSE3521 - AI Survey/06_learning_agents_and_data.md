# Intro
Uncertainty and oversimplification caused issues with classic AI models!
We are good at making decisions but not good at explaining our decisions. It's harder for us to define rules of how we make our decisions than to make decisions. 

Solution: Let's make the machine learn itself and let it create rules itself. 
This is *machine learning*!

## Key parts
*Data*: collected from past observations (training data)
*Modeling*: devised to capture the patterns in data. All models are wrong! They may just be useful. 
*Prediction*: apply the model to forecast what is going to happen in the future.
