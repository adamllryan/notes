## Overview
At the highest level, an **operating system** is a program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware. 

A good operating system should:
- Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier.
- Make the computer convenient to use.
- Efficiently use the computer hardware. 

In all, an operating system is a **resource allocator** and **control program**. It manages all resources and decides which conflicting resource requests should be handled first. It also controls the execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. 

However, it is important to note that there is no *universally* accepted definition of an operating system. Typically, it is "everything a vendor ships when you order an operating system", but it still varies wildly. 

## Kernel
Every operating system has a **kernel**, which is the program that is running at all times. It is responsible for all operations and scheduling of any other program, which will either be a **system program** or an **application program**. 

## System Structure
The computer system structure is made up of a few main components: the hardware, operating system, application programs, and users. 

### Hardware
Computer hardware, in the scope of basic operating systems, is comprised of CPU, memory, and I/O devices. 

### Operating System
The operating system controls and coordinates the use of hardware among various applications and users. 

### Application Programs
Application programs define how the system resources are used to solve user compute jobs. These may include word processors, compilers, web browsers, database systems, and video games. 

### Users
Users are the people, machines, and other computers that use this specific machine's resources. 

## Startup
When a computer starts up, it doesn't load the operating system. Stored in ROM or EPROM is the computer's **firmware**, which is a **bootstrap program** that is responsible for loading the operating system kernel and all other aspects of the system. 

## Virtualization
**Virtualization** is the concept of treating each program running on a machine as if it were the only one running. Multiple programs should be able to concurrently run on one machine as well as allow multiple users to log in and access resources. Virtualization is the reason we can write programs without worrying about other programs and memory sharing (in most cases). 

With virtualization, each program assumes that it is the only program and has exclusive control of the CPU and memory despite being shared by many other programs. 

## Concurrency
When we run multiple programs at the same time, concurrent execution can introduce subtle correctness issues that are destructive. 

The classic example is with a banking application, where two users are modifying a balance. Suppose the application on both of their ends reads the balance at the same time, both getting $100. Without concurrency protection, whoever writes the new balance first will be overwritten. Suppose user 1 adds $10 to the balance and user 2 adds $20 in this situation, and user 1's transaction goes through first. The balance becomes $110, and then $120, because the balance has simply been added to what they originally read. Money is lost, and the same happens if user 2's transaction goes through first. 

To fix issues like this, we need to implement concurrency control mechanisms to guarantee the correctness of concurrent programs. 

## Organization
The computer-system operation structure typically begins with the CPU. There should be at least one, and they are linked by the **bus**, which provides access to shared memory and device controllers. **Device controllers** are responsible for being the links between disk, I/O devices, and graphics. On the other side, all of these are connected to system memory, which stores all of the information for fast retrieval. 

Because I/O devices and CPU are separated, they can execute concurrently. Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type and has its own local buffer. First, the CPU moves data between the main memory and local buffers. I/O is transported from the attached device into the local buffer of its controller, and the controller notifies the CPU that it has finished its operation with an interrupt. 

## Interrupts
The kernel has an **interrupt vector** that contains the addresses of all service routines. Interrupt architecture states that it must save the address of the interrupted instruction. Once the kernel receives an interrupt, all incoming interrupts are disabled until the current one is completed to avoid *lost interrupts*. 

More specifically, a **trap** is a software-generated interrupt at the user's request or due to an error. Operating systems are **interrupt-driven**. 

## Persistency
An important goal for operating systems is the idea of **persistency**, or the retention of data through reboots and loss of power. To do so, we use persistent storage mediums or **file systems**. Since machines may crash at any time, our file system should be consistent no matter when a crash happens. 

## Storage
**Secondary storage** is an extension of main memory consisting of a large quantity of nonvolatile storage. Typically, data is stored on magnetic disks or flash memory (not covered). Disks are divided logically into tracks and then further into sectors. The disk controller determines the logical interaction between the device and the computer. 

## I/O
When a program requests I/O, control is taken from that program and given fully to the requested I/O device. Upon request completion, control is returned to the user program. The CPU gives a wait instruction that causes idling until the next interrupt, and any conflicting I/O requests are blocked. 

Alternatively, we can have control return to the user program right as I/O begins and wait for a **system call**, which is a request to the operating system to allow the user to wait for I/O completion. A **device-status table** is then used to store entries for each I/O device with a type, address, and state. The operating system indexes into this table to determine the device status and modify the table entry to include the interrupt. 

## Direct Memory Access
Another important concept is **direct memory access**, giving device controllers the ability to bypass the CPU completely and write straight into main memory. Device controllers can transfer blocks of data from their buffer storage directly into main memory at close-to-memory speeds. In this situation, only one interrupt is generated per block instead of per byte.
